For the purposes of this section, ''affiliate'' shall include holding company affiliates, but shall not include any person or corporation the control of which is held by a bank when acting in a fiduciary capacity.  \\n(d) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the commissioner may establish a tiered regulatory structure for the supervision and examination of savings banks, co-operative banks and trust companies. The criteria for the tiered regulatory structure may include, but shall not be limited to, the following: asset size; level of capital; balance sheet composition; the rating under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System, so-called CAMELS rating; record of performance under the community reinvestment act in section 14; compliance with laws and regulations; and such other factors as the commissioner may determine. In establishing the tiered regulatory structure the commissioner shall seek to effect cost reductions and reduce the regulatory burden for savings banks, co-operative banks and trust companies. The commissioner may promulgate rules and regulations necessary to carry out this subsection.\\nSection 2. (a)(1) The commissioner, either personally or by his examiners or such other assistants that he designates, shall, at least once in each calendar year, or at least once in an 18â€“month period in the case of a bank which is well capitalized as defined in 12 U.S.C. Â§ 1831(o) and the regulations adopted under that section, or as authorized under subsection (d), make a thorough examination of the books, securities, cash, assets and liabilities and ascertain the condition of all banks under the commissioner's supervision, including out-of-state branches, the ability of each bank to fulfill its obligations and whether it has complied with all applicable laws.  The commissioner may also, whenever he considers it expedient, make or cause to be made, at the expense of the bank, any further examinations or audits by his examiners or by certified public accountants or public accountants approved by him and subject to his direction and not connected with the bank.  The commissioner may also, whenever he considers it expedient, appoint individuals certified as real estate appraisers by the Society of Real Estate Appraisers or a similar successor society to make, at the expense of the bank, appraisals of real estate securing loans of the bank. When the commissioner appoints an appraiser, he shall so notify the bank of the date on which he has requested submission of the appraisal report to him. The bank may then appoint an appraiser who may submit the report of his appraisal to the commissioner on the same date.\\n(2) The commissioner or the person making the examination shall, at the time of the examination, have free access to the vaults, investments, cash, books and papers. In making an examination, the commissioner shall have access to the vaults, books and papers of each of the bank's affiliates and may make any examination of the affairs of its affiliates that may be necessary to disclose fully the relations between the bank and its affiliates and the effect of this relationship upon the affairs of the bank.\\n(b)(1) The commissioner shall preserve a full record of an examination of a bank, including a statement of its condition. All records of investigations and reports of examinations by the commissioner, including workpapers, information derived from the reports or responses to the reports and any copies of the records in the possession of a bank under the supervision of the commissioner, shall be confidential and privileged communications, shall not be subject to subpoena and shall not be a public record under clause Twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4. For the purposes of this paragraph, records of investigations and reports of examinations shall include records of investigation and reports of examinations conducted by a financial regulatory agency of the federal government or of a state or a foreign government which are considered confidential by the agency or foreign government and which are in possession of the commissioner. In a proceeding before a court, the court may issue a protective order to seal the record protecting the confidentiality of these records, other than a record on file with the court or filed in connection with the court proceeding, and the court may exclude the public from any portion of the proceeding at which the record may be disclosed.\\n(2) Copies of reports of these examinations shall be furnished to the bank for its use only and shall not be exhibited to any other person, organization or agency without the prior written approval of the commissioner. The commissioner may, in his discretion, furnish to the Chief National Bank Examiner, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Depositors Insurance Fund, the Cooperative Central Bank, the Massachusetts Credit Union Share Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the federal Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection or any successors to these entities, any other bank regulatory or law enforcement agency, or the banking departments of other states or foreign countries, any information, reports and statements relating to the institutions under his supervision that he considers appropriate.\\n(c)(1) An annual charge shall be paid by each bank under the supervision of the commissioner which shall be based on the total amount of assets held by each bank as stated on the most recent report to the commissioner filed before December 31 of the preceding year. The charge assessed to all such banks shall be determined based on a calculation of the amount that would be sufficient to pay for the operations of the division of banks in the amount set forth in the division's appropriation for the fiscal year, and each bank shall pay the charge within 30 days after receiving notice from the commissioner of the charge assessed. The notice shall be issued annually by the commissioner on January 31. The charge shall be determined annually by the secretary of administration and finance under section 3B of chapter 7, with the assistance of the commissioner, and may contain such classifications and differentiations based upon the financial condition of such banks as he considers appropriate. Classifications of individual institutions shall be exempt from section 10 of chapter 66. The annual charge shall be paid, on a pro rata basis, by the successor of any bank which is merged into, or whose assets are purchased and its deposit liabilities are assumed by, a federally-chartered or out-of-state bank during the preceding year. No annual charge shall be collected from a bank which has been in operation for 1 year or less. The aggregate amount of charges assessed by the division of banks for a fiscal year under this section and other applicable fee provisions shall not be less than the aggregate amount of revenues for the fiscal year as estimated for the division of banks or its successor agency in section 1B of the general appropriation act for that fiscal year.\\n(2) If the assessment in a fiscal year by the division of banks is insufficient to pay for the operations of the division of banks in the amount set out in its annual appropriation and any additional appropriations for that fiscal year, the division of banks shall assess the remaining amount upon all depository and nondepository financial institutions under the supervision of the division. This assessment shall be determined by regulations of the secretary of administration and finance under section 3B of chapter 7, with the assistance of the commissioner, and may contain such classifications and differentiations based upon the regulatory condition of each institution as the commissioner considers necessary. The classifications of individual institutions shall be exempt from section 10 of chapter 66. The assessment shall be paid within 30 days after notice from the commissioner of the amount due.\\n(3) The expense of the examination of the affairs of an affiliate of a bank, including all monies expended by the commonwealth for personal services and the proportion of the general overhead of the division of banks and loan agencies, including travel, hotel and meal allowances and other costs that are determined by the commissioner to be attributable to the examination or audit, shall be paid by the affiliate examined. For the purposes of this section, ''affiliate'' shall include holding company affiliates, but shall not include any person or corporation the control of which is held by a bank when acting in a fiduciary capacity.\\n(d) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the commissioner may establish a tiered regulatory structure for the supervision and examination of savings banks, co-operative banks and trust companies. The criteria for the tiered regulatory structure may include, but shall not be limited to, the following: asset size; level of capital; balance sheet composition; the rating under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System, so-called CAMELS rating; record of performance under the community reinvestment act in section 14; compliance with laws and regulations; and such other factors as the commissioner may determine.

(a) For purposes of this section, the word ''company'' shall mean an insurance company licensed pursuant to chapter 175 and the word ''affiliate'' shall have the same meaning as established in section 1 of chapter 167A.  \\n(b) A bank shall have the power to sell, either directly or indirectly through an affiliate or a subsidiary corporation established for the purpose or a third party agreement, and acting as an insurance producer licensed pursuant to section 162M or 162N of chapter 175, such insurance products as a company, for which such bank, affiliate, subsidiary corporation or third party acts as insurance producer, is authorized to issue in the commonwealth. No bank exercising such power shall assume or guarantee the payment on any premiums on such products or guarantee the truth of any statement contained in the application therefor. Said sales shall be conducted in accordance with conditions and limitations that the commissioner shall promulgate by regulation and which shall reflect the substance of conditions established by the comptroller of the currency of the United States governing the sale of insurance products by a national bank as a licensed agent of an insurance company.

Said conditions and limitations shall include, but not be limited to, the following provisions:â€”  \\n(1) No bank, except a bank licensed as an agent for the savings bank life insurance company of Massachusetts and only to the extent of the authority granted under such license, shall undertake to act directly or indirectly as an insurance producer, in any manner permitted by this section, until the commissioner approves a general plan of operation submitted by such a bank that conforms with the regulations promulgated pursuant to this section. Said plan shall include a detailed description of the complaint resolution procedure, including bank personnel designated for its enforcement, required pursuant to subparagraph (9) of this section.  \\n(2) Officers, tellers and other employees of a bank who are not licensed as insurance agents may refer a customer of said bank to a licensed insurance agent of the bank only when such customer initiates an inquiry relative to the availability or acquisition of insurance products. No such officer, teller or other employee shall be further or additionally compensated for making said referrals.  \\n(3) The solicitation or sale of insurance products shall be permitted at the main office of a bank, or at any branch thereof established pursuant to chapter 167C, or at any other bank office, not including an electronic branch established pursuant to chapter 167B. Said solicitation or sale shall be conducted on the premises of a bank in a distinctly designated area which is separate and apart from any physical setting in which services for insured deposit account transactions or transactions involving applications for the extension of credit are conducted. The commissioner may waive the requirement for the physical separation of bank and insurance services only upon a demonstration by a bank that space considerations, such as the size or design of said bank premises, preclude such separation. The commissioner may allow for such use of a common area for both purposes if, subject to notice and hearing at the commissioner's discretion, said waiver application demonstrates physical constraints that are consistent with criteria the commissioner shall establish for such waivers. In any instance where such waiver is granted, a bank employee, licensed as an insurance agent, shall not, in any manner involving the application by a customer for an extension of credit by said bank, act as the representative of the bank both with respect to said application and with respect to the solicitation and sale of insurance products to said customer, whether or not such insurance is required for the extension of credit.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any premises constructed, purchased, leased or acquired by a bank on and after the effective date of this section for the conduct of its authorized business, including the solicitation and sale of insurance, shall not be eligible for the waiver provided for herein, unless said acquisition results from a merger, consolidation or purchase of assets pursuant to chapters 168, 170 and 172.  \\n(4)(i) A bank is hereby prohibited from tying the availability and extension of credit by a bank to the purchase of insurance products from said bank.  \\n(ii) No solicitation for the sale of insurance in conjunction with any application for the extension of credit shall be permitted until said application has been approved, such approval and the disclosures required by this section have been provided to said applicant in writing, and the receipt of both said approval and disclosures has been acknowledged in writing by said applicant. The date, time and method of the communication of said approval and disclosures to the applicant, together with the applicant's acknowledgment of the receipt thereof, shall be made a permanent part of the bank record of such extension of credit. This paragraph shall not apply in situations where a bank contacts a customer in the course of direct or mass marketing of insurance products to a group of persons in a manner that bears no relation to any such person's loan application or credit decision.  \\n(iii) In the instance of an application to a bank for an extension of credit to be secured by a mortgage on real estate and in which it is necessary for the applicant to obtain a policy insuring said premises against loss and designating such bank as loss payee, (i) said bank shall make the initial disclosure of the necessity of such insurance in its letter of commitment to the applicant approving the requested extension of credit; (ii) such bank shall not, in any manner, solicit the applicant to purchase the required insurance from the bank until said commitment has been accepted by the applicant; and (iii) such bank shall not reject any such policy, so long as it satisfies the required insurance, because the policy was issued by a company other than that for which the bank acts as agent in the sale of insurance products.  \\n(5) Rebates shall be regulated pursuant to the provisions of section 185 of chapter 175.  \\n(6) A bank, through its licensed insurance producers, shall disclose in writing to a potential insurance customer that: (i) the insurance products which are available are not deposits of the bank, are not protected by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other type of deposit insurance, are not an obligation of or guaranteed by the bank, and may be subject to risk; (ii) any insurance required as a condition of the extension of credit by the bank need not be purchased from the bank but may, without affecting the approval of the application for an extension of credit, be purchased from an agent or insurance company of the customer's choice; and (iii) the customer may file any complaints with the office of consumer affairs and business regulations as hereinafter provided. The disclosures required by this section shall be provided in writing, and receipt thereof shall be acknowledged in writing by the customer.  \\n(7) Bank customer information security and confidentiality shall be regulated pursuant to the provisions of chapter 175I of the General Laws and the provisions of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act.  \\n(8) No bank engaged in the direct sales of insurance products shall discriminate against an applicant or allow an affiliate, a subsidiary corporation established for the purpose or a third party acting on its behalf to discriminate against an applicant for any insurance products offered by it based upon the race, color, national origin or residence of the applicant, or on such other basis as the commissioner may determine. No bank offering insurance products at its main office or any branch thereof established pursuant to chapter 167C, shall refuse to offer the same at every such branch of the bank.  \\n(9) A bank engaged in the direct sale of insurance products, or an affiliate, subsidiary corporation or third party acting on its behalf, shall forthwith forward copies of all customer complaints relative to its insurance sales activities to the office of consumer affairs and business regulation established by section 1 of chapter 24A. The director of said office shall cause a record of all such complaints received to be maintained and shall, depending upon the nature of the complaint, refer any such complaint for resolution to the appropriate banking or insurance regulator in the division of banks and loan agencies or the division of insurance. The commissioner, in conjunction with the commissioner of insurance, shall establish a procedure for the prompt resolution of such consumer complaints. Regulations promulgated by the commissioner under this section shall include provisions for investigation and resolution by a bank of customer complaints and for the requirement to forward all complaints so received to the office of consumer affairs and business regulation.  \\n(c) Any violations of the provisions contained in this section shall be subject to the applicable provisions of chapter 167, including, but not limited to, sections 2A to 2G, inclusive, and to applicable provisions of chapter 175 and chapter 176D, including, but not limited to, penalties, cease and desist orders, and suspension or loss of license.  \\n(d) The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to the authority granted by paragraphs 16 and 17 of section 2 of chapter 167F and section 12G of chapter 255.  \\n(e) The commissioner shall promulgate regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.  \\n(f) For purposes of this section, the term ''bank'' shall include small loan companies licensed pursuant to section 96 of chapter 140, and mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers licensed pursuant to chapter 255E; provided, however, that the provisions of clause (i) of paragraph (6) shall not apply to such small loan companies or to such mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers which do not accept deposits; and provided, further, that said licensees shall be eligible to apply to the commissioner of banks for a waiver, in accordance with the provisions of this section, for premises utilized for the conduct of authorized business in the commonwealth.  \\n(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the commissioner, in his discretion, may furnish to the commissioner of insurance information, reports and statements relating to the sale of insurance by banks under his supervision which are licensed by the division of insurance pursuant to section 209 of chapter 175.\\nSection 2A. (a) For purposes of this section, the word ''company'' shall mean an insurance company licensed pursuant to chapter 175 and the word ''affiliate'' shall have the same meaning as established in section 1 of chapter 167A.\\n(b) A bank shall have the power to sell, either directly or indirectly through an affiliate or a subsidiary corporation established for the purpose or a third party agreement, and acting as an insurance producer licensed pursuant to section 162M or 162N of chapter 175, such insurance products as a company, for which such bank, affiliate, subsidiary corporation or third party acts as insurance producer, is authorized to issue in the commonwealth. No bank exercising such power shall assume or guarantee the payment on any premiums on such products or guarantee the truth of any statement contained in the application therefor. Said sales shall be conducted in accordance with conditions and limitations that the commissioner shall promulgate by regulation and which shall reflect the substance of conditions established by the comptroller of the currency of the United States governing the sale of insurance products by a national bank as a licensed agent of an insurance company. Said conditions and limitations shall be in addition to and consistent with the provisions of said chapter 175 and regulations promulgated thereunder by the commissioner of insurance with respect to the licensing of insurance producers and the sale of insurance products. Said conditions and limitations shall include, but not be limited to, the following provisions:â€”\\n(1) No bank, except a bank licensed as an agent for the savings bank life insurance company of Massachusetts and only to the extent of the authority granted under such license, shall undertake to act directly or indirectly as an insurance producer, in any manner permitted by this section, until the commissioner approves a general plan of operation submitted by such a bank that conforms with the regulations promulgated pursuant to this section. Said plan shall include a detailed description of the complaint resolution procedure, including bank personnel designated for its enforcement, required pursuant to subparagraph (9) of this section.\\n(2) Officers, tellers and other employees of a bank who are not licensed as insurance agents may refer a customer of said bank to a licensed insurance agent of the bank only when such customer initiates an inquiry relative to the availability or acquisition of insurance products. No such officer, teller or other employee shall be further or additionally compensated for making said referrals.\\n(3) The solicitation or sale of insurance products shall be permitted at the main office of a bank, or at any branch thereof established pursuant to chapter 167C, or at any other bank office, not including an electronic branch established pursuant to chapter 167B. Said solicitation or sale shall be conducted on the premises of a bank in a distinctly designated area which is separate and apart from any physical setting in which services for insured deposit account transactions or transactions involving applications for the extension of credit are conducted. The commissioner may waive the requirement for the physical separation of bank and insurance services only upon a demonstration by a bank that space considerations, such as the size or design of said bank premises, preclude such separation. The commissioner may allow for such use of a common area for both purposes if, subject to notice and hearing at the commissioner's discretion, said waiver application demonstrates physical constraints that are consistent with criteria the commissioner shall establish for such waivers. In any instance where such waiver is granted, a bank employee, licensed as an insurance agent, shall not, in any manner involving the application by a customer for an extension of credit by said bank, act as the representative of the bank both with respect to said application and with respect to the solicitation and sale of insurance products to said customer, whether or not such insurance is required for the extension of credit. It shall be the responsibility of a bank to institute procedures to eliminate customer misunderstanding or confusion as to the distinction between such insurance products and other bank functions, and to prevent any misrepresentation thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any premises constructed, purchased, leased or acquired by a bank on and after the effective date of this section for the conduct of its authorized business, including the solicitation and sale of insurance, shall not be eligible for the waiver provided for herein, unless said acquisition results from a merger, consolidation or purchase of assets pursuant to chapters 168, 170 and 172.\\n(4)(i) A bank is hereby prohibited from tying the availability and extension of credit by a bank to the purchase of insurance products from said bank.\\n(ii) No solicitation for the sale of insurance in conjunction with any application for the extension of credit shall be permitted until said application has been approved, such approval and the disclosures required by this section have been provided to said applicant in writing, and the receipt of both said approval and disclosures has been acknowledged in writing by said applicant. The date, time and method of the communication of said approval and disclosures to the applicant, together with the applicant's acknowledgment of the receipt thereof, shall be made a permanent part of the bank record of such extension of credit. This paragraph shall not apply in situations where a bank contacts a customer in the course of direct or mass marketing of insurance products to a group of persons in a manner that bears no relation to any such person's loan application or credit decision.\\n(iii) In the instance of an application to a bank for an extension of credit to be secured by a mortgage on real estate and in which it is necessary for the applicant to obtain a policy insuring said premises against loss and designating such bank as loss payee, (i) said bank shall make the initial disclosure of the necessity of such insurance in its letter of commitment to the applicant approving the requested extension of credit; (ii) such bank shall not, in any manner, solicit the applicant to purchase the required insurance from the bank until said commitment has been accepted by the applicant; and (iii) such bank shall not reject any such policy, so long as it satisfies the required insurance, because the policy was issued by a company other than that for which the bank acts as agent in the sale of insurance products.\\n(5) Rebates shall be regulated pursuant to the provisions of section 185 of chapter 175.\\n(6) A bank, through its licensed insurance producers, shall disclose in writing to a potential insurance customer that: (i) the insurance products which are available are not deposits of the bank, are not protected by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other type of deposit insurance, are not an obligation of or guaranteed by the bank, and may be subject to risk; (ii) any insurance required as a condition of the extension of credit by the bank need not be purchased from the bank but may, without affecting the approval of the application for an extension of credit, be purchased from an agent or insurance company of the customer's choice; and (iii) the customer may file any complaints with the office of consumer affairs and business regulations as hereinafter provided. The disclosures required by this section shall be provided in writing, and receipt thereof shall be acknowledged in writing by the customer.\\n(7) Bank customer information security and confidentiality shall be regulated pursuant to the provisions of chapter 175I of the General Laws and the provisions of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act.\\n(8) No bank engaged in the direct sales of insurance products shall discriminate against an applicant or allow an affiliate, a subsidiary corporation established for the purpose or a third party acting on its behalf to discriminate against an applicant for any insurance products offered by it based upon the race, color, national origin or residence of the applicant, or on such other basis as the commissioner may determine. No bank offering insurance products at its main office or any branch thereof established pursuant to chapter 167C, shall refuse to offer the same at every such branch of the bank.\\n(9) A bank engaged in the direct sale of insurance products, or an affiliate, subsidiary corporation or third party acting on its behalf, shall forthwith forward copies of all customer complaints relative to its insurance sales activities to the office of consumer affairs and business regulation established by section 1 of chapter 24A. The director of said office shall cause a record of all such complaints received to be maintained and shall, depending upon the nature of the complaint, refer any such complaint for resolution to the appropriate banking or insurance regulator in the division of banks and loan agencies or the division of insurance. The commissioner, in conjunction with the commissioner of insurance, shall establish a procedure for the prompt resolution of such consumer complaints. Regulations promulgated by the commissioner under this section shall include provisions for investigation and resolution by a bank of customer complaints and for the requirement to forward all complaints so received to the office of consumer affairs and business regulation.\\n(c) Any violations of the provisions contained in this section shall be subject to the applicable provisions of chapter 167, including, but not limited to, sections 2A to 2G, inclusive, and to applicable provisions of chapter 175 and chapter 176D, including, but not limited to, penalties, cease and desist orders, and suspension or loss of license.\\n(d) The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to the authority granted by paragraphs 16 and 17 of section 2 of chapter 167F and section 12G of chapter 255.\\n(e) The commissioner shall promulgate regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.\\n(f) For purposes of this section, the term ''bank'' shall include small loan companies licensed pursuant to section 96 of chapter 140, and mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers licensed pursuant to chapter 255E; provided, however, that the provisions of clause (i) of paragraph (6) shall not apply to such small loan companies or to such mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers which do not accept deposits; and provided, further, that said licensees shall be eligible to apply to the commissioner of banks for a waiver, in accordance with the provisions of this section, for premises utilized for the conduct of authorized business in the commonwealth.\\n(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the commissioner, in his discretion, may furnish to the commissioner of insurance information, reports and statements relating to the sale of insurance by banks under his supervision which are licensed by the division of insurance pursuant to section 209 of chapter 175.\", 'metadata': {'date_downloaded': '061324 21:55:29', 'site_url': 'https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter167F/Section2A', 'extra_data': {'heading': 'Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.) applying to the financial services industry.', 'sub_heading': 'Chapter 167F: INVESTMENTS AND OTHER POWERS', 'section': 'Section 2A: Sale of insurance by banks'}}, 'volunteer_id': '2121', 'location': 'Pune, Maharashtra, India'}, {'text': 'Section 3.

In any instance where a waiver is granted, a credit union employee, licensed as an insurance agent, shall not, in any manner involving the application by a member for an extension of credit by the credit union, act as the representative of the credit union both with respect to the application and with respect to the solicitation and sale of insurance products to the member, whether or not the insurance is required for the extension of credit. It shall be the responsibility of a credit union to institute procedures to eliminate member misunderstanding or confusion as to the distinction between insurance products and other credit union functions, and to prevent any misrepresentation thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any premises constructed, purchased, leased or acquired by a credit union on and after the effective date of this section for the conduct of its authorized business, including the solicitation and sale of insurance, shall not be eligible for the waiver provided for herein, unless the acquisition results from a merger or consolidation pursuant to chapter 171.\\n(4) (A) A credit union is hereby prohibited from tying the availability and extension of credit by a credit union to the purchase of insurance products from the credit union.\\n(B) No solicitation for the sale of insurance in conjunction with any application for the extension of credit shall be permitted until the application has been approved, approval and the disclosures required by this section have been provided to the applicant in writing, and the receipt of both the approval and disclosures has been acknowledged in writing by the applicant. The date, time and method of the communication of the approval and disclosures to the applicant, together with the applicant's acknowledgment of the receipt thereof, shall be made a permanent part of the credit union record of the extension of credit. This paragraph shall not apply in situations where a credit union contacts a member in the course of direct or mass marketing of insurance products to a group of persons in a manner that bears no relation to a member's loan application or credit decision.\\n(C) In the instance of an application to a credit union for an extension of credit to be secured by a mortgage on real estate and in which it is necessary for the applicant to obtain a policy insuring said premises against loss and designating the credit union as loss payee, (i) the credit union shall make the initial disclosure of the necessity of insurance in its letter of commitment to the applicant approving the requested extension of credit; (ii) the credit union shall not, in any manner, solicit the applicant member to purchase the required insurance from the credit union until the commitment has been accepted by the applicant member; and (iii) the credit union shall not reject any policy, so long as it satisfies the required insurance, because the policy was issued by a company other than that for which the credit union acts as agent in the sale of insurance products.\\n(5) Rebates shall be regulated pursuant to section 183 of chapter 175.\\n(6) A credit union, through its licensed insurance agents or brokers, shall disclose in writing to a member who is a potential insurance purchaser that:  (i) the insurance products which are available are not deposits of the credit union, are not protected by the national credit union share insurance fund or any other type of deposit insurance, are not an obligation of or guaranteed by the credit union, and may be subject to risk; (ii) any insurance required as a condition of the extension of credit by the credit union need not be purchased from the credit union but may, without affecting the approval of the application for an extension of credit, be purchased from an agent or insurance company of the member's choice; and (iii) the member may file any complaints with the office of consumer affairs and business regulations as hereinafter provided. The disclosures required by this section shall be provided in writing, and receipt thereof shall be acknowledged in writing by the member.\\n(7) Credit union member information security and confidentiality shall be regulated pursuant to chapter 175I and the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act.\\n(8) No credit union engaged in the direct sales of insurance products shall discriminate against an applicant member or allow an affiliate established for the purpose or a third party acting on its behalf to discriminate against an applicant for any insurance products offered by it based upon the race, color, national origin or residence of the applicant, or on such other basis as the commissioner may determine. No credit union offering insurance products at its main office or any branch thereof established pursuant to chapter 171 or 12 U.S.C. section 1752(9), shall refuse to offer the same at every such branch of the credit union.\\n(9) A credit union engaged in the direct sale of insurance products, or an affiliate or third party acting on its behalf, and whether acting as insurance agent or broker, shall forthwith forward copies of all member complaints relative to its insurance sales activities to the office of consumer affairs and business regulation established by section 1 of chapter 24A. The director of the office shall cause a record of all complaints received to be maintained and shall, depending upon the nature of the complaint, refer any complaint for resolution to the appropriate banking or insurance regulator in the division of banks and loan agencies or the division of insurance. The commissioner, in conjunction with the commissioner of insurance, shall establish a procedure for the prompt resolution of member complaints. Regulations promulgated by the commissioner under this section shall include provisions for investigation and resolution by a credit union of member complaints and for the requirement to forward all complaints so received to the office of consumer affairs and business regulation.\\n(c) Any violations of the provisions contained in this section shall be subject to chapter 167, including, but not limited to, sections 2A to 2G, inclusive, and to applicable chapter 175 and chapter 176D, including, but not limited to, penalties, cease and desist orders, and suspension or loss of license.\\n(d) This section shall not apply to the authority granted by the seventh and ninth paragraphs of section 75 of chapter 171 and section 12G of chapter 255.\\n(e) The commissioner shall promulgate regulations necessary to carry out this section.\\n(f) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the commissioner, in his discretion, may furnish to the commissioner of insurance information, reports and statements relating to the sale of insurance by credit unions under his supervision which are licensed by the division of insurance pursuant to section 209 of chapter 175.\\n(g) In the event that any of the provisions of this section or of section 2A of chapter 167F, are preempted by the National Credit Union Administration, by the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States pursuant to section 114 of the federal Reigleâ€“Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (P.L.103â€“328), by section 104 of the federal Grammâ€“Leachâ€“Bliley Act of 1999 (P.L. 106â€“102), by a court of competent jurisdiction or by any other applicable law, the commissioner of banks, with respect to this section, and the commissioner of insurance, with respect to sections 209 and 210 of chapter 175 may waive, in writing, the applicability of the preempted provisions to credit unions and to federal credit unions if it is determined the waiver is necessary in order to permit the entities to engage in the solicitation and sale of insurance under similar laws as banks chartered by the commonwealth pursuant to chapter 168, 170 or 172 or chartered by the laws of the United States. The waiver shall be filed with the state secretary and shall, unless otherwise provided by law, become effective on the sixtieth day following the date of the filing.
