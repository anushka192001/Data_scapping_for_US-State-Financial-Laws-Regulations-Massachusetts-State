The objectives of the fund shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following: supporting, in conjunction with other private, public and philanthropic resources, the development and implementation of employer and worker responsive programs to enhance worker skills, incomes, productivity and retention and to increase the quality and competitiveness of Massachusetts firms; training and helping the unemployed find suitable employment; improving employment opportunities for low-income individuals and low wage workers; improving wages to a level sufficient to support a family or to place individuals on a career path leading to such employment and wages; training vulnerable youths to master basic academic skills, including the attainment of a high school degree and encouraging students to advance educationally and receive post-secondary degrees at colleges or post-secondary vocational schools or beyond; developing occupational skills and becoming employed in jobs that have career potential; and training older workers for new occupations. The department shall utilize these projects to improve the workforce development system by integrating employer and worker needs more fully into program design and delivery. The department shall support, through grants, partnership programs and planning, grant applications from the following eligible applicants to provide an integrated continuum of education and training: employers and employer associations; local workforce investment boards; labor organizations; community-based organizations, including adult basic education providers; institutions of higher education; vocational education institutions; one-stop career centers; local workforce development entities; and nonprofit education, training or other service providers. The fund shall leverage employer, public, philanthropic and other contributions and shall be available as a state match for federal funds that meet the requirements of the fund. The fund shall be an expendable trust fund and not subject to appropriation. Grants from the fund shall be offered on a competitive basis for a maximum of 3 years and shall not exceed $500,000. These grants shall be known as the ''Senator Kenneth J.

The director shall serve as chair of the committee. The committee shall supply constituent focused labor market information, review general programmatic parameters and guidelines, assist with the identification of issues and barriers to the fund's efficiency and effectiveness and the dissemination of relevant information about the fund and support the general oversight of the fund's implementation. The committee shall meet from time to time, but not less frequently than quarterly.\\n(c) The Commonwealth Corporation shall be the administrator of the fund and shall maintain the fund as a separate fund and shall cause it to be audited by an independent accountant on an annual basis in accordance with generally-accepted accounting principles.\\n(d) There shall be credited to the fund any revenue from appropriations or other monies authorized by the general court and specifically designated to be credited to the fund, and any gifts, grants, private contributions, investment income earned on the fund's assets and all other sources. Money remaining in the fund at the end of a fiscal year shall not revert to the General Fund.\\n(e) Partnership programs may include costs for support services including, but not limited to, transportation and childcare, to eliminate barriers to participation in the training program. For any unionized employer participating as a partner in a grant application, the impacted union shall be an active participant in the design and implementation of the grant.\\n(f) A competitive grant program shall be established that provides support to partnerships and eligible applicants as described above, and that leverages applicant co-investment of at least 30 per cent of the grant amount from employers, philanthropic and public or private organizations. The period of grant operations may be up to 3 years in duration. Grants may be targeted to specific populations, such as educationally or economically disadvantaged youth, low-income, low-skilled and low-wage workers, disabled citizens or industries that are deemed to be of critical consequence to the commonwealth. Special grant programs and funding allocations shall be determined by the committee and shall be distributed by a regionally-based competitive bid process, which shall require the defining of economic regions based on labor market factors as determined by the committee. Each municipality shall be accounted for in a designated region. A formula for regional distribution shall be created and competition for formula grant funds shall occur within each identified region and shall be subject to the rules and regulations established by the committee in consultation with regional partners. Respondents to the local competitions shall notify, in writing, the region's workforce investment board of their intent to respond to the request for proposals. A planning grant may be offered to define employer needs; to make necessary curriculum and other programmatic improvements to align with employer and worker needs; to determine the feasibility of a proposed workforce development intervention; to plan for and coordinate strong partnerships among stakeholders; to identify educational and skill needs of workers and program participants; to link training initiatives with employer-based career ladders; and to develop case management and additional support services that would address barriers to participation.\\n(g) A portion of the grant fund shall be used to support the current and future labor force needs of the healthcare industry. This portion of the fund shall support projects that address barriers and gaps in the healthcare workforce development pipeline. Small planning and needs assessment grants may be offered.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any contractor debarred or suspended by any agency of the United States shall by reason of such debarment or suspension be simultaneously debarred or suspended under this section, with respect to non-federally aided contracts; the secretary or the commissioner may determine in writing that special circumstances exist which justify contracting with the affected contractor.

The secretary or the commissioner shall determine whether to impose the suspension or, in the case of an emergency suspension imposed prior to notice to the contractor, whether to continue the suspension after reviewing the contractor's response, if any, and making such investigation as the secretary or the commissioner determines is necessary and appropriate. An indictment, or any information or other filing by a public agency charging a criminal offense, for any of the offenses listed in paragraph (1) of subsection (c) shall constitute adequate evidence to support a suspension.  \\nIf the contractor requests a hearing, and the suspension is not based on an indictment, the secretary or the commissioner shall conduct a hearing according to the rules for the conduct of adjudicatory hearings established by the secretary of administration and finance under chapter 30A.

The notice shall inform the contractor of the reasons for the debarment and shall state that the contractor will be afforded an opportunity for a hearing if the contractor so requests within 14 days of receipt of the notice. A hearing requested under this subsection shall be conducted by the secretary or the commissioner within 60 days of receipt of the request, unless the secretary or the commissioner grants additional time for the hearing at the request of the contractor. The hearing shall be conducted according to the rules for the conduct of adjudicatory hearings established by the secretary of administration and finance under chapter 30A. A debarment shall not be imposed until (i) 14 days after receipt by the contractor of notice of the proposed debarment if no hearing is requested, or (ii) the issuance of a written decision by the secretary or the commissioner which makes specific findings that there is sufficient evidence to support the debarment and that debarment for the period specified in the decision is required to protect the integrity of the public contracting process. A contractor shall be notified forthwith of the decision by registered or certified mail, and of the contractor's right to judicial review in the event that the decision is adverse to the contractor. If a suspension precedes a debarment, the suspension period shall be considered in determining the debarment period.  \\n(f) A debarment or suspension may include all known affiliates of a contractor. The decision to include a known affiliate within the scope of a debarment or suspension shall be made on a case-by-case basis, after giving due regard to all relevant facts and circumstances.

The entity's acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct shall be evidence of such knowledge, approval, or acquiescence. The offense or act of an entity justifying debarment, or the evidence justifying a suspension, may be imputed to any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee or other individual associated with the entity who participated in, knew of, or had reason to know of the entity's act. An entity or individual shall not be suspended or debarred except under the procedures in this section, provided that a public agency may reject a bid or proposal from any contractor when the public agency reasonably determines that such contractor is not responsible or eligible.  \\n(g) In determining whether to debar a contractor, or the period of a debarment, all mitigating facts and circumstances shall be taken into consideration. Except as precluded by law, a debarment may be removed or the period of debarment may be reduced by the secretary or the commissioner who imposed the debarment or suspension upon the submission of an application supported by documentary evidence setting forth appropriate grounds for the granting of relief, such as newly discovered material evidence, reversal of a judgment or conviction, bona fide change of ownership or management or the elimination of the cause for which the debarment was imposed.  \\n(h) During the period for which a person has been debarred or suspended, that person shall not submit or cause to be submitted offers, bids or proposals to any public agency, nor shall any public agency solicit or consider offers, bids or proposals from, nor execute, renew or extend any contract with, a debarred or suspended contractor and a contractor shall not contract for supplies or services from a debarred or suspended subcontractor on any public contract.  \\n(i) The secretary of administration and finance shall by regulation drawn up in consultation with each secretary and the commissioner provide for, upon the request of any secretary or the commissioner the timely commencement by, the removal to, or consolidation at the executive office for administration and finance of debarment or suspension proceedings. Such regulations also shall provide that the contractor against whom debarment or suspension proceedings have been initiated may apply to the secretary of administration and finance for consolidation of such proceedings at the executive office for administration and finance.

A secretary or the commissioner, as the case may be, upon imposing a debarment or suspension or removing a suspension shall forthwith notify the secretary of administration and finance of all information required for inclusion on such list.\\n(c) Debarment may be imposed for the following causes but debarment shall be imposed in all causes where debarment is required by law:\\n(1) conviction or final adjudication by a court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction of any of the following offenses: (i) a criminal offense incident to obtaining or attempting to obtain a public or private contract or subcontract, or in the performance of such contract or subcontract; (ii) a criminal offense involving embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, receiving stolen property or any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty which seriously and directly affects the contractor's present responsibility as a public contractor; (iii) a violation of state or federal antitrust laws arising out of the submission of bids or proposals; (iv) a violation of state or federal laws regulating campaign contributions; (v) a violation of chapter 268A; (vi) a violation of any state or federal law regulating hours of labor, prevailing wages, minimum wages, overtime pay, equal pay, child labor, or worker's compensation; (vii) a violation of any state or federal law prohibiting discrimination in employment; or (viii) repeated or aggravated violation of any state or federal law regulating labor relations or occupational health or safety; or (ix) repeated or aggravated violation of any state or federal law protecting the environment; or (x) a violation of federal law prohibiting the employment of unauthorized aliens; or\\n(2) substantial evidence, as determined by a secretary or the commissioner, of any of the following acts: (i) willfully supplying materially false information incident to obtaining or attempting to obtain or performing any public contract or subcontract; (ii) willful failure to comply with record-keeping and accounting requirements prescribed by law or regulation; (iii) a record of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory performance under the terms of 1 or more public contracts, provided that such failure to perform or unsatisfactory performance has occurred within a reasonable period of time preceding the determination to debar and provided further that such failure to perform or unsatisfactory performance was not caused by factors beyond the contractor's control; (iv) a record of health and safety or environmental violations of a sufficient frequency and severity so as to evidence a pattern of noncompliance with existing state and federal laws, or any rules and regulations applicable thereto; (v) any other cause affecting the responsibility of a contractor which the secretary or the commissioner determines to be of such serious and compelling nature as to warrant debarment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any contractor debarred or suspended by any agency of the United States shall by reason of such debarment or suspension be simultaneously debarred or suspended under this section, with respect to non-federally aided contracts; the secretary or the commissioner may determine in writing that special circumstances exist which justify contracting with the affected contractor. The secretary or the commissioner shall give written notice to the secretary of administration and finance of any such determination.\\n(d) No contractor may be suspended unless a secretary or the commissioner has first informed the contractor by written notice of the proposed suspension mailed by registered or certified mail to the contractor's last known address, except when the secretary or the commissioner determines that immediate suspension is necessary to prevent serious harm to the commonwealth, in which case the suspension shall take effect immediately upon signing by the secretary or the commissioner of an order of suspension, and notice shall be mailed to the contractor at the earliest opportunity. The notice shall inform the contractor of the reasons for the proposed suspension and shall state that the contractor may within 14 days respond in writing and may in such response request a hearing. The secretary or the commissioner may extend the period for response at the request of the contractor. The secretary or the commissioner shall determine whether to impose the suspension or, in the case of an emergency suspension imposed prior to notice to the contractor, whether to continue the suspension after reviewing the contractor's response, if any, and making such investigation as the secretary or the commissioner determines is necessary and appropriate. An indictment, or any information or other filing by a public agency charging a criminal offense, for any of the offenses listed in paragraph (1) of subsection (c) shall constitute adequate evidence to support a suspension.\\nIf the contractor requests a hearing, and the suspension is not based on an indictment, the secretary or the commissioner shall conduct a hearing according to the rules for the conduct of adjudicatory hearings established by the secretary of administration and finance under chapter 30A. Such hearing shall be initiated within 30 days of the imposition of the suspension, unless the contractor requests that the hearing be delayed. Officers and employees of the office of the inspector general and records of said office shall not be subject to subpoena for such hearing, if in the opinion of the inspector general production of records or testimony would prejudice any pending investigation by said office.\\nA suspension shall not exceed 12 months unless a pending administrative or judicial proceeding in which the contractor is a party may result in a conviction or final adjudication of an offense listed in paragraph (1) of subsection (c).\\n(e) No contractor may be debarred under this section unless a secretary or the commissioner proposing the debarment has first informed the contractor by written notice of the proposed debarment mailed by registered or certified mail to the contractor's last known address. The notice shall inform the contractor of the reasons for the debarment and shall state that the contractor will be afforded an opportunity for a hearing if the contractor so requests within 14 days of receipt of the notice. A hearing requested under this subsection shall be conducted by the secretary or the commissioner within 60 days of receipt of the request, unless the secretary or the commissioner grants additional time for the hearing at the request of the contractor. The hearing shall be conducted according to the rules for the conduct of adjudicatory hearings established by the secretary of administration and finance under chapter 30A. A debarment shall not be imposed until (i) 14 days after receipt by the contractor of notice of the proposed debarment if no hearing is requested, or (ii) the issuance of a written decision by the secretary or the commissioner which makes specific findings that there is sufficient evidence to support the debarment and that debarment for the period specified in the decision is required to protect the integrity of the public contracting process. A contractor shall be notified forthwith of the decision by registered or certified mail, and of the contractor's right to judicial review in the event that the decision is adverse to the contractor. If a suspension precedes a debarment, the suspension period shall be considered in determining the debarment period.\\n(f) A debarment or suspension may include all known affiliates of a contractor. The decision to include a known affiliate within the scope of a debarment or suspension shall be made on a case-by-case basis, after giving due regard to all relevant facts and circumstances. The offense or act of an individual justifying suspension, or the evidence justifying a suspension, may be imputed to the entity with which the individual is connected when such offense or act occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of the entity or with the knowledge, approval, or acquiescence of the entity or 1 or more of its principals. The entity's acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct shall be evidence of such knowledge, approval, or acquiescence. The offense or act of an entity justifying debarment, or the evidence justifying a suspension, may be imputed to any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee or other individual associated with the entity who participated in, knew of, or had reason to know of the entity's act. An entity or individual shall not be suspended or debarred except under the procedures in this section, provided that a public agency may reject a bid or proposal from any contractor when the public agency reasonably determines that such contractor is not responsible or eligible.\\n(g) In determining whether to debar a contractor, or the period of a debarment, all mitigating facts and circumstances shall be taken into consideration. Except as precluded by law, a debarment may be removed or the period of debarment may be reduced by the secretary or the commissioner who imposed the debarment or suspension upon the submission of an application supported by documentary evidence setting forth appropriate grounds for the granting of relief, such as newly discovered material evidence, reversal of a judgment or conviction, bona fide change of ownership or management or the elimination of the cause for which the debarment was imposed.\\n(h) During the period for which a person has been debarred or suspended, that person shall not submit or cause to be submitted offers, bids or proposals to any public agency, nor shall any public agency solicit or consider offers, bids or proposals from, nor execute, renew or extend any contract with, a debarred or suspended contractor and a contractor shall not contract for supplies or services from a debarred or suspended subcontractor on any public contract.\\n(i) The secretary of administration and finance shall by regulation drawn up in consultation with each secretary and the commissioner provide for, upon the request of any secretary or the commissioner the timely commencement by, the removal to, or consolidation at the executive office for administration and finance of debarment or suspension proceedings. Such regulations also shall provide that the contractor against whom debarment or suspension proceedings have been initiated may apply to the secretary of administration and finance for consolidation of such proceedings at the executive office for administration and finance.

The aggregate principal amount of bonds, if any, of any issue of commonwealth bonds stated to mature in any year may vary from the aggregate principal amount of bonds of such issue stated to mature in any other year. The state treasurer may agree at or prior to the time such issue of bonds is issued with the holders of bonds of such issue or with a trustee, which shall be a trust company or bank with trust powers doing business in the commonwealth, for the benefit of such holders to establish a sinking fund for such issue of bonds, to make deposits into such sinking fund according to a schedule theretofore established by the state treasurer and to use the monies in such sinking fund only for (a) the payment of principal of or interest on, or purchase, at a price not to exceed par of, the bonds of such an issue or (b) the payment of principal of or interest on, or purchase, at a price not to exceed par of, the bonds of any 1 or more specified maturities of such an issue.

All expenditures shall have 1 or more of the following purposes: (1) to improve and enhance the ability of community hospitals to serve populations efficiently and effectively; (2) to advance the adoption of health information technology, including interoperable electronic health records systems; (3) to accelerate the ability to electronically exchange information with other providers in the community to ensure continuity of care; (4) to support infrastructure investments necessary for the transition to alternative payment methodologies, including technology investments in data analysis functions and performance management programs, including systems to promote provider price transparency, necessary to aggregate and analyze clinical data on a population level; (5) to aid in the development of care practices and other operational standards necessary for certification as an ACO under section 15 and 6D; and (6) to improve the affordability and quality of care.  \\n(d) The commission shall annually award a grant by a competitive grant process to qualified acute hospitals. To be eligible to receive a grant under this subsection, a qualified acute hospital shall not include: (1) any hospital that is a teaching hospital; (2) any hospital whose relative prices are above the statewide median relative price, as determined by the center for health information analysis; or, (3) a for-profit hospital or a hospital that is part of a for-profit hospital system.  \\n(e) A grant proposal submitted under subsection (d) shall include, but not be limited to: (1) a plan that defines specific goals for improving the efficiency and affordability of hospital care over a multi-year period; (2) the evidence-based programs the applicant shall use to meet the goals; (3) a budget necessary to implement the plan, including a detailed description of any funding or in-kind contributions the applicant or applicants will be providing in support of the proposal; (4) a plan for sustaining any investments after the expiration of grant funds; and (5) any other private funding or private sector participation the applicant anticipates in support of the proposal.  \\nIn reviewing the grant applications, the commission shall consider, among other factors: (1) the financial health of the qualified acute hospital and the demonstrated need for investment, taking into account all resources available to the particular provider including the relationship or affiliation of the particular provider to a health care delivery system and the capacity of the system to provide financial support for the acute hospital; (2) the anticipated return on investment, as measured by improved health care coordination and a reduction in health care costs; (3) whether the investment will support innovative health care delivery and payment models as identified by the health care policy commission; and (4) geographic need and population need. In assessing financial health, the commission shall, in consultation with the center for health information and analysis, take into account days cash on hand, net working capital and earnings before income tax, payer mix, uncompensated care, and depreciation and amortization, and access to working capital. If the commission determines that no suitable proposals have been received, such that the specific needs remain unmet, the commission may work directly with qualified acute hospitals to develop grant proposals.  \\n(f) All approved grants shall contain a limit on the amount an acute hospital may spend on administrative or overhead spending related to the approved project, as determined by the commission.  \\n(g) Funding for all approved interoperable health information technology projects for qualified acute hospitals shall be prioritized from any available funds in the Distressed Hospital Trust Fund before any funds from the e-Health Institute Trust Fund may be utilized.  \\n(h) As a condition of an award, the commission may require a qualified hospital to agree to an independent financial and operational audit to recommend steps to increase sustainability and efficiency of the acute hospital.  \\n(i) The commission shall develop guidelines for an annual review of the progress being made by each grantee.
