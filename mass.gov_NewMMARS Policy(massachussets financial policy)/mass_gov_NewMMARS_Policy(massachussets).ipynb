The Office of the Comptroller has provided the \\nExpenditure Classification Handbook and this Policy Chapter to identify expenditures and related \\nrequirements. \\n \\nPolicy \\nComptroller Implementation of State Accounting System and Internal Controls \\n \\nThe Comptroller has broad authority to prescribe accounting rules and instructions for all state \\nDepartments and the appropriate use of the state accounting system.  Pursuant to G.L. c. 7A, § 7, G.L. c. \\n7A, § 8,  G.L. c. 7A, § 9 and G.L. c. 29, § 31 the Comptroller is required to implement a state accounting \\nsystem (including a centralized payroll system) and issue instructions for the accounting practices to be \\nused by all Departments for supplies, materials, assets, liabilities, equity, debt, encumbrances, \\nexpenditures, revenues, expenses and obligations of all Commonwealth funds and accounts, including \\npayroll, unless specifically exempted by general or special law.  The Comptroller has full authority to \\nprescribe, regulate and make changes in the method of keeping and rendering accounts and is authorized \\nto direct state Departments to implement changes in their systems to meet these statewide standards. \\n \\nOSD Statutory Authority And Oversight Of Procurement of Commodities and Services \\n \\nThe statutory authority vested in the State Purchasing Agent and OSD to oversee the procurement of \\ncommodities and services by Commonwealth entities is found in G.L. c. 7, s. 22, G.L. c. 30, s. 51 and G.L. \\nc. 30, s. 52. These statutes form the basis of OSD’s issuance of its procurement regulation, 801 CMR \\n21.00, which provides all Commonwealth Departments with uniform rules and standards governing the \\nprocurement of commodities or services, or both, including human and social services for clients. While \\nthese statutes specifically exempt the legislative branch and military division from their applicability, they \\nalso do not apply to all or part of the procurements of the following Commonwealth entities: \\n \\n• \\nThe judicial branch pursuant to Article 30 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of the \\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, which sets forth the separation of powers principle in the \\nMassachusetts Constitution. There is also case law, which supports the separation of powers of the \\nthree branches of state government but specifically states that it does not preclude participation on a \\nvoluntary basis. \\n \\n• \\nCities and towns and still-existing county entities of the Commonwealth, which must follow G.L. c. \\n30B, although they may purchase off of OSD statewide contracts per G.L. c. 7, s. 22A and G.L. c. 30B, \\ns. 1(c). OSD has no oversight authority over G.L. c. 30B or these entities. Although not required to do \\nso, cities and towns frequently purchase from statewide contracts because it saves them the time of \\nconducting their own procurement under G.L. c. 30B and the prices available from statewide contracts \\nare often more competitive due to the Commonwealth’s purchasing power. \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 3 of 48 \\n \\n• \\nThe University of Massachusetts, State Colleges and Community Colleges and the Higher Education \\nConsortium, which have statutory authority to conduct certain procurements pursuant to G.L. c. 75, s. \\n13, G.L. c. 73, s. 15, G.L. c. 15A, s. 24 and G.L. c. 15A, s. 24A. However, where these statutes are \\nsilent, these entities fall under OSD’s statutes and authority. \\n \\nIn addition, OSD has the authority, pursuant to St. 1993, c. 110, s. 274, as amended in St. 1993, c. 151, \\ns. 113; St. 1993, c. 296, s. 3; and St. 1993, c. 495, s. 99 and G.L. c. 29, s. 29B to oversee the \\nprocurement of human and social services by Commonwealth Human and Social Services Departments.  \\n \\nThese statutes form the basis for issuance of OSD’s regulation, codified as 808 CMR 1.00, which governs \\ncontract compliance, financial reporting and auditing requirements applicable to all procurements of \\nHuman and social services and to G.L. c.71B approved private schools subject to the authority of OSD. \\nRegulation 808 CMR 1.00 also describes the methods used by OSD in authorizing prices for approved \\nprivate school special education programs. For more information on OSD\\'s legal and regulatory authority, \\nplease contact OSD\\'s Legal Bureau at OSDLegal@osd.state.ma.us. \\n \\nQuality Assurance \\n \\nThe Comptroller has been granted full access to the books and papers of all Departments unless \\nspecifically exempted by general or special law.  The Comptroller has the authority to access all \\nDepartments records related to accounting transactions, and may conduct quality assurance reviews to \\nensure Department compliance with state finance law and Comptroller accounting instructions.  CTR works \\ncooperatively with OSD to ensure compliance with procurement and contract requirements.  Please see \\nPolicy Chapter “Contracts – Quality Assurance” and OSD’s Procurement Information Center (PIC).    \\n \\nMMARS is the Official Record of Fiscal Activities \\n \\nThe uniform system of accounting is known as the Massachusetts Management and Accounting System \\n(MMARS).  MMARS is a computerized electronic accounting system that has been established as the official \\nrecord of the Commonwealth’s accounting activities.  The Comptroller has established a series of fiscal \\ncontrols in the system to manage financial risks, reduce incorrect and incomplete entries and to prevent \\nthe payment of expenditures which exceed available funding.   \\n \\nWhat appears in the MMARS system will be considered the “official record” or “record copy” of fiscal \\nactivities and will supersede paper or other formats of the same information.  Departments must \\nremember that MMARS is an accounting system, used to accurately record and report on fiscal activities. \\n  \\n \\nFiscal Activity Based Upon a Series of Reliances \\n \\n \\n \\nIn order to support the Comptroller’s statutory responsibilities, state government fiscal transactions are \\nmanaged in MMARS through a series of reliances: \\n \\nThe Governor’s Council approves the warrant relying upon the “certification” by the Comptroller.  (G.L. c. \\n29, § 18) \\nThe Comptroller certifies expenditures on a warrant relying upon the “certification” of the Department \\nHead or designee evidenced by an electronic signature approval of a transaction in MMARS. (G.L. c. 7A, s. \\n3, G.L. c. 29, § 61; G.L. c. 29, § 20) \\nIt is imperative that everything entered into MMARS is verified as \\naccurate and complete before a document is submitted to Final status. \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 4 of 48 \\nThe Department Head certifies expenditures and other obligations in MMARS by relying on the Chief Fiscal \\nOfficer and other authorized Department Head signatories to manage the day-to day business of the \\nDepartment and approve expenditures on behalf of the Department Head; \\nThe Chief Fiscal Officer and other Department Head authorized signatories who approve purchases and \\nexpenditures, rely on staff to make purchases and confirm receipt, delivery and acceptance of \\ncommodities and services (including payroll) in accordance with prescribed laws, regulations, policies and \\nprocedures. \\n \\nSince the Comptroller cannot personally review and certify all payments from all state Departments, the \\nComptroller has set up the state accounting system (MMARS) with a series of checks and balances to \\nbalance fiscal risks with administrative and business efficiencies.  The Comptroller relies on Department \\nHeads to ensure that all payments and other documents sent to the Comptroller for certification through \\nMMARS have been approved by the Department Head as being legal, appropriate and properly submitted \\nin accordance with applicable law, policies and procedures. \\n \\nAlthough MMARS is an effective management tool, Departments can not rely solely on the MMARS system \\nto manage fiscal responsibility and decisions.  MMARS will not always prevent mistakes or incorrect \\nentries.  Some documents will pass all the system tests (edits) and be processed to Final status even \\nthough the expenditure, underlying procedures, procurement process, or contract documentation is legally \\ndeficient.  Therefore, just because Department staff are capable of processing a document to Final status \\nin MMARS will not be interpreted to mean that the document, or underlying documentation are \\nautomatically legal, appropriate or in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, policies or procedures.  \\nCompliance responsibility remains at all times with the Department staff who process documents to Final \\nstatus.  Since MMARS will track the staff who approves documents, quality assurance reviews will identify \\nnot only the documents that will be reviewed, but also the security identification of the individual(s) who \\nentered and approved the documents.   \\n \\nIn order to support the series of reliances, the Comptroller establishes requirements for the management \\nof Department Head Signature Authorization, Internal Control Plan Updates and Electronic Signatures for \\nMMARS transactions.  These policies and any applicable procedures shall apply to all Departments unless \\nspecifically exempted.  A Department’s use of MMARS requires at a minimum, agreement to comply with \\nComptroller laws, regulations, policies and procedures, even if other general or special laws exempt the \\nDepartment from compliance with Executive Branch requirements.   \\n \\nFiling of Department Head Signature Authorization (DHSA) as part of Internal Controls \\n \\nPursuant to G.L. c. 7A, s. 3, G.L. c. 29, § 61 and G.L. c. 29, § 31 prior to certifying any expenditure for \\npayment on a warrant the Comptroller requires that legislative leadership, judicial branch administrators, \\nelected officials, secretariats and Department Heads certify in an affidavit that articles have been \\nfurnished, services rendered (including payroll) or obligations incurred, as certified.   \\n \\nA Department Head is responsible for all activities conducted by the Department.  A Department must be \\nauthorized to enter into contracts in order to make payments against contracts and the Department Head \\nor designee must approve itemized expenditures. See G.L. c. 29, § 19.  \\n \\nIn order to obtain MMARS Security, all Department Heads (including new Department Heads) are required \\nto accept these responsibilities and conditions. \\nSee:  Department Head MMARS Security Certification Form \\n \\nSince a Department Head cannot personally review and certify all business transactions, the Department \\nHead is responsible for setting up the Department’s business operations with a series of checks and \\nbalances (known as internal controls) to balance fiscal risks with administrative and business efficiencies.  \\nA Department Head relies on the delegation of signature authorization to authorized signatories within the \\nDepartment who conduct the day-to-day business of the Department. \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 5 of 48 \\nA Department Head delegates signature authority to staff who will be responsible for conducting business \\non behalf of the Department Head in accordance with applicable law, regulations, policies and procedures.  \\nDelegation of Department Head signature authorization (DHSA) is an efficient administrative tool that \\nallows a Department Head to designate key staff who can incur obligations, make expenditures and \\nconduct the day to day Department activities on behalf of the Department Head. \\nIn order to support the use of electronic signatures each Department agrees that it will conduct all fiscal \\nbusiness in accordance with state finance law, including but not limited to G.L. c. 7A and G.L. c. 29, and \\nlaws, regulations, policies and procedures of the Office of the Comptroller. \\n \\nIf a Department is within the Legislative or Judicial Branch or is a non-Executive Department or institution, \\nagreeing to comply with state finance laws, including Comptroller laws, regulations, policies and \\nprocedures will not by implication extend compliance to Executive Orders or other Executive Branch \\ndirectives that this Department would not normally be subject to, unless the ability to use certain MMARS \\ntransactions, system functionality or benefits (such as transaction delegation or incidental purchases) \\ninvolves compliance with certain minimum requirements (such as the use of standard Commonwealth \\nboilerplate contracts, or compliance with minimum procedures).  If a Department chooses to take \\nadvantage of these benefits, the Department will comply with the minimum requirements identified by \\nCTR for these benefits, unless otherwise provided. \\n \\nAll staff with Department Head signature authorization to sign or approve documents, obligations or \\nexpenditures will be assigned to MMARS Administrator security roles.  Staff processing documents with \\nthese roles will not be required to obtain a signature or any additional authorization prior to processing a \\ndocument to Final status.  MMARS transactions processed with “Administrator” roles without Department \\nHead Signature Authorization will require sign off by an authorized signatory prior to making the \\ndocument final.  Such delegation shall not relieve the Department Head from any obligations or \\nresponsibilities under applicable general and special laws, regulations, policies and procedures. \\n \\nSince Administrator roles have the security to incur obligations and make payments, the Security Officer is \\nresponsible for ensuring that any Administrator roles are approved by the Department Head.  Changes to \\nAdministrator roles must be approved promptly by the Department Head and filed as part of the \\nDepartment’s Internal Controls and will also be communicated without delay to the Comptroller’s Security \\nOfficer.   \\n \\nAny MMARS transaction submitted to Final status and any underlying supporting documentation shall \\noperate as the Department Head’s certification that the documents are accurate and complete and that \\nthe expenditure or other obligation is supported by sufficient legislatively authorized funds and is made in \\naccordance with this Department’s legislative mandates and funding authority; and complies with all \\napplicable laws, regulations, policies and procedures.  Please see Policy Chapter “Department Head \\nSignature Authorization and Electronic Signatures for MMARS transactions” and Policy Chapters \\non MMARS “Security” for additional information. \\n \\nDirect Authorization for Department Head and Secretariat Signature Authorization (DHSA) – No \\nSub-delegation \\n \\nEach Department Head must directly authorize individuals to be their designee for approval of fiscal \\ndocuments or other legal obligations on their behalf.  There can be no sub-delegation by designees.  \\nAn individual granted signature authorization may not in turn sub-delegate Department Head \\nSignatory Authority to other individuals.  Each individual exercising signature authorization must be \\ndirectly authorized by the Department Head.  \\n \\n \\nAppointment of New Department Head \\n \\nWhen a new Department Head is appointed several duties the new Department Head must complete \\ninclude: \\n1. executing a Department Head Certification Form accepting electronic signature, record keeping and \\ncompliance with Comptroller laws, regulations, policies and procedures related to MMARS; \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 6 of 48 \\n2. the designation or ratification of Key State Finance Law Compliance Officers who will be responsible \\nfor assisting the Department Head with state finance law compliance; \\n3. the verified Assignment or ratification of individuals with MMARS Security Administrator roles, \\nincluding Administrator roles with Department Head signature authorization in each of MMARS \\nfunctional areas.  MMARS security roles will remain in place during any transition period when a \\nnew Department Head is appointed, but must be assigned or ratified within 30 days after a \\nDepartment Head assumes Department Head responsibilities. \\n \\nSecretariat Signature Authorization \\n \\nDirect delegation also applies to secretariat signatories.  Cabinet Secretaries must directly authorize \\nindividuals within their own Department, or in other Departments within the secretariat, to be their \\ndesignee to approve legal obligations, fiscal documents or other legal documents on the Secretary’s \\nbehalf.  Secretariat signoff is limited to circumstances requiring secretariat signoff.  For example, a \\nCabinet Secretary who wishes to enable Departments within the Secretariat to signoff on consultant \\nservice contracts in the “HH” and “NN” object classes and “U05” object code pursuant to G.L. c. 29, \\nSection 29A, and Human and Social Service contracts in the “MM” object class pursuant to G.L. c. 29, \\nSection 29B, must directly designate those individuals who will have this signature authorization at each \\nDepartment.  \\n \\nHowever, secretariat signoff provided to a Department within the secretariat will NOT authorize \\nthe Department designee to sign off on a secretariat contract, invoice, payroll or other \\nobligation.  A Department designee with secretariat authorization can only provide secretariat signoff for \\nits own Department obligations, not obligations of the secretariat as a Department.   \\n \\nSecretariat signoff is not captured as part of MMARS transaction approvals and therefore, there is no \\nMMARS security role which reflects secretariat signoff delegation, and no cross-Department security.  \\nSecretariats and Departments that have secretariat signoff delegation will be required to record this \\ndelegation as part of its internal controls.  For contracts requiring secretariat signoff, the approval must be \\nobtained prior to the effective start date of contract.  CTR and OSD will not verify secretariat signoff as \\npart of prior review (if applicable) but will verify signoff as part of quality assurance reviews.  There is no \\nstandard format for secretariat signoff.  The Department can obtain secretariat signoff of the RFR or the \\ncontract, provided the signoff is obtained prior to the effective start date of the contract and the format for \\nobtaining the secretariat signoff is reliable and verifiable.  Processing a contract MMARS transaction to \\nFinal status will act as a certification to the Comptroller that secretariat signoff has been obtained.  \\nCompliance with this requirement shall be subject to audit.   \\n \\nDepartment Head and Secretariat Signature Authorization Delegation Must Support Department \\nBusiness Needs \\n \\nSince Department Head and Secretariat authorized signatories may not sub-delegate their authorization to \\nother individuals, Department Head and Secretariat Signature Authorization should be structured to \\nensure that there are sufficient staff authorized to approve contracts, transactions, payroll and other \\ncritical business needs during staff vacations, maternity leave, sick leave or other leave or unavailability. \\n \\nFor example, a Payroll Officer who is authorized to approve payroll, or a Chief Fiscal Officer who is \\nauthorized to approve contracts, may not in turn sub-delegate Department Head signature authorization \\nresponsibility to other individuals during their absence or unavailability.  Department Head Signature \\nAuthorization should support Department business needs so that these officers have back up staff for \\nnecessary approvals.  Each Department should establish internals controls that identify how signature \\nauthorization will be implemented during these absences. \\n \\nLive Signatures And Dates Required On Contracts And Other Legal Obligations \\n \\nElectronic signatures are authorized only for the MMARS electronic accounting transactions \\nwhich support a Department’s business and legal obligations. \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 7 of 48 \\nTherefore, electronic signatures are authorized only to encumber funds, authorize payments or other fiscal \\ntransactions necessary to support contracts (grants, InterDepartmental Service Agreements (ISAs), \\nleases, subsidies, etc.) payments and other legislatively authorized activities. \\n \\nUnless otherwise authorized by the Comptroller, the record copy of all contracts, payrolls and other legal \\nobligations and related supporting documentation must be maintained by the Department in paper and \\nmust contain \"live\" signatures and dates.  The record copy of a contract or other legal obligation includes \\nthe following: \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAn original or duplicate original contract or document signed by the Department Head (or \\nauthorized signatory) and an authorized signatory of the Contractor. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nA copy of the original contract or document bearing the words “Certified True Copy” or “True Attest \\nCopy” and bearing the signature and date of the individual who is certifying or attesting that they \\nhave seen the original and have compared the copy with the original document and certify that the \\ncopy is a true copy of the original contract or document. \\n \\nLive signatures and dates are entered in pen by the Department Head or authorized signatory, and a \\nContractor or other party (if applicable).  The date of a signature is an inseparable part of the signature, \\nwhich documents the actual date of a signatory’s authorization.  Date stamps, typed or any other method \\nof pre-filled dates do not comply with this requirement. \\n \\nWhen CTR, OSD or other oversight Department performs a secondary review in order for a document to \\nbe completed to Final status in MMARS, a Department should submit photocopies (not originals) of the \\ndocuments and supporting documentation to the oversight Department.  Any original documents and \\ntransactions (including duplicate originals if not clearly marked duplicate original) submitted for processing \\nwill be returned to the Department.  Contracts, payments and other documents must reference applicable \\nelectronic accounting transactions (by document reference or identification number).  Photocopies \\nreviewed by CTR, OSD or other oversight Department will not be considered record copies and will be \\ndisposed of after use. \\n \\nThe only exception to these instructions will apply when the Comptroller or another oversight Department \\nis responsible for contracting or making payments on behalf of a Department, such as for Statewide \\nContracts, Settlements or Judgments, Tort Claims, Prior Year Deficiencies, or when the original of a \\ndocument is required to be filed at the oversight Department (such as MA substitute Form W-9s for \\nVendor or Customer registration, the Commonwealth Terms and Conditions, or the Commonwealth Terms \\nand Conditions for Human and Social Services filed at the Office of the Comptroller).  Departments will be \\nresponsible for submitting the original or a certified copy of the original contract or other document.  A \\ncertified or attested copy is a copy that has been reviewed and compared with the original documentation, \\nand is certified by the reviewer as a true copy of the original documentation.  The Comptroller or other \\noversight Department will be responsible for retaining and archiving the record copy of these documents \\nin accordance with the requirements of the Records Conservation Board and 815 CMR 10:00. \\n \\nDepartments will be responsible for maintaining and archiving the record copies of contracts and other \\nlegal obligations in accordance with records retention requirements of the Records Conservation Board and \\n815 CMR 10:00.  MMARS financial records will be maintained by the Comptroller with the assistance of the \\nInformation Technology Division in accordance with records retention requirements of the Records \\nConservation Board, the Information Technology Division and G.L. c. 110F. \\n \\nElectronic Signatures in MMARS \\n \\nElectronic signatures are limited to MMARS transactions and certain Comm-PASS documents.  Electronic \\nsignatures can not yet be used for contracts, amendments or Tax Identification Form including, \\nbut not limited to the Commonwealth Standard Contract Form, Standard Contract Amendment \\nForm or the Commonwealth Terms and Conditions.  However, OSD does allow, for Comm-PASS \\nsubscribers that are submitting a bid electronically, the electronic submission and signature of other forms \\nas long as final contract execution includes wet ink signatures on the Commonwealth Standard Contract, \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 8 of 48 \\nStandard Contract Amendment, Commonwealth Terms and Conditions, Authorized Signatory Listing and \\nMA substitute W-9 Forms. \\n \\nThis restriction does not apply to RFRs and responses to RFRS that are submitted electronically through \\nComm-PASS, provided that contracts, amendments and other documents requiring signatures (W-9s etc.) \\nare submitted in hard copy with a wet signature.  Therefore, Departments may negotiate a contract, an \\namendment or communicate electronically, but any contract or amendment must be finalized with written \\n(wet) signatures by authorized signatories of the Department and Contractor. \\n \\nUnder G.L. c. 110G, the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (added by St. 2003 c. 133) an \"electronic \\nsignature\" is defined as “an electronic sound, symbol, or process attached to or logically associated with a \\nrecord and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record.”  An electronic signature \\nwill be treated as if the authorized individual executed a written signature and date. \\n \\nIn accordance with G.L. c. 110G, the Comptroller is authorized to specify additional requirements for the \\nretention of electronic records subject to the Comptroller’s jurisdiction.  Since all MMARS activity is subject \\nto the Comptroller’s authority, the Comptroller establishes the minimum necessary requirements for the \\nuse of electronic signatures for MMARS activity in addition to any requirements of the Information \\nTechnology Division and the Records Conservation Board in accordance with G.L. c. 110G. \\n \\nElectronic Signature and Department Head Authorization of MMARS transactions  \\n \\nWith the implementation of the MMARS accounting system the Office of the Comptroller is aligning \\nElectronic Security with Department Head Signature Authorization (DHSA) begun in fiscal year 2005 to \\ntake advantage of electronic signatures for MMARS processing.  Every MMARS action must be \\nconfirmed/authorized by the Department Head or an authorized signatory.  Department head \\nauthorization can be accomplished in one of two ways: \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAdministrator Security with DHSA.  If the employee (Administrator - system processor) who \\nsubmits a document to Final status is a Department Head authorized signatory, the data in the \\nMMARS system will be sufficient documentation.  What appears in MMARS will be the record copy \\nof the document.   \\no \\nRecording Doc Id on all supporting documentation.  Since there is no paper copy \\nrequired for the MMARS transaction the Department will be required to include the MMARS \\ntransaction Identification number (Doc ID) on all supporting documentation to “match” the \\nsupporting documentation with the electronic record of the MMARS transaction which will \\nreside on MMARS.  Recording the Doc Id on all supporting documentation can be \\naccomplished by entry of the MMARS Doc Id on the first page of the supporting \\ndocumentation, or by entering the Doc Id on a MMARS transaction Authorization/Records \\nManagement Form which will act as the cover sheet to the supporting documentation for \\nrecords management purposes.   \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAdministrator Security without DHSA.  If the employee (Administrator - system processor) who \\nwill be submitting a document to Final status is not a Department Head authorized signatory, the \\nAdministrator must obtain a live (“wet”) signature from an authorized signatory approving the \\ndocument PRIOR to submitting the document to Final status in MMARS. \\no \\nReview of document and supporting documentation.  Since a Department Head is \\nrequired to authorize the official record of a MMARS transaction, which is what actually \\nappears in the MMARS system, Departments must ensure that whoever authorizes the \\ndocument has reviewed the document and related supporting documentation prior to \\nauthorization. \\no \\nWritten authorization. The written authorization may appear on a screen-print of the \\ndocument as entered and validated, but prior to final submission, or on a MMARS \\ntransaction Authorization/Records Management Form prescribed by CTR to capture \\nthe prior authorization for documents. \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 9 of 48 \\no \\nFiling of authorization with supporting documentation.  Authorization documentation \\nmust be kept on file at the Department along with the record copy of other supporting \\ndocumentation related to the MMARS transaction.  See Records Management below. \\n \\nWhat does electronic signature of a MMARS transaction mean? \\n \\nWhen a Department electronically submits a document to Final status in MMARS, the Department Head is \\ncertifying to the Comptroller that the individual, on behalf of the Department Head, understands that their \\nUAID (universal access identification) is being recorded for any entries made in the MMARS system and \\nthat that individual certifies under the pains and penalties of perjury that: \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nit is their intent to attach an electronic signature approval and date to the MMARS transaction, and \\nthat \\n\\uf0a7 \\nthey are either an authorized signatory of the Department Head who is authorized to approve the \\nMMARS transaction as part of the Department Internal Control Plan, OR \\n\\uf0a7 \\nthat the document they are processing and any supporting documentation have been approved by \\nan authorized signatory of the Department Head, secretariat and any other required prior approval \\n(including secretariat signoff if required) and a copy of these approvals are available at the \\nDepartment referencing the MMARS transaction number, and that \\n\\uf0a7 \\nany expenditure or other obligation is supported by sufficient available legislatively authorized \\nfunds and is in accordance with the Department’s enabling legislation and funding authority; and \\nthat \\n\\uf0a7 \\nthe MMARS transaction and any underlying supporting documentation are accurate and complete \\nand comply with all applicable general and special laws, regulations and policies including public \\nrecord intention and disposal requirements. \\n \\nThe fact that the MMARS system “allows” a document to process to Final status does not mean that the \\ndocument is automatically legal, in compliance with legislative or funding authority, or properly authorized \\nby a Department Head.  Therefore, staff must be trained that merely finding a systemic way to process a \\ndocument to Final status is insufficient, and that they will be held responsible and accountable for all \\nactivity under their UAID.  Individuals unsure of proper processing or required approvals have an \\nobligation to obtain guidance and approvals from their Chief Fiscal Officer prior to processing a document \\nto Final status. \\n \\nIndividuals who are granted electronic security access to submit MMARS transactions to Final status are \\ncapable of incurring legal obligations and making expenditures of Department funds that will be binding \\nupon the Department.  Since documents submitted to Final status will be considered electronically \\napproved by the Department Head, a Department will be responsible for all actions made by any individual \\nprovided with electronic approval security and may not later claim that an individual was not authorized to \\napprove an expenditure, obligation, transfer or payment. \\n \\nTherefore, a CFO and Security Officer should not grant electronic security Administrator access to allow \\nsubmission of MMARS transactions to Final status unless the Department can maintain sufficient internal \\ncontrols, oversight and quality assurance (post audit) reviews to ensure that individuals exercise such \\nelectronic security authorization in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, policies and procedures. \\n \\nSince approval security in MMARS acts as the Department Head’s approval and certification, Department \\nHeads should ensure that electronic approval security in MMARS is granted only to individuals who have \\nbeen delegated Department Head Signature Authorization (DHSA).  In larger Departments, the number of \\nindividuals granted (DHSA) by the Department Head may not be able to personally process all of the fiscal \\ndocuments necessary to support the fiscal actions they approve.  In addition, a Department Head may not \\nwant to grant Department Head signature authorization to the number of individuals necessary to process \\nthese fiscal transactions.  Therefore, the CFO and Security officer will be responsible for authorizing \\nelectronic security to enable efficient Department business provided that no MMARS transaction, under \\nany circumstances is submitted to Final status without first being approved by an authorized \\nsignatory of the Department Head. \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 10 of 48 \\nIt is a serious breach in internal controls and MMARS fiscal policies for any document to be submitted to \\nFinal status without first being approved by an authorized signatory of the Department Head.  Compliance \\nwith these policies will be subject to Quality Assurance reviews by the Office of the Comptroller. \\n \\nDepartment heads will be required to execute a certification accepting electronic signature, record keeping \\nand compliance responsibilities under MMARS before any electronic security is granted to a Department.  \\nPlease see Policy Chapter “Department Head Signature Authorization and Electronic Signature for \\nMMARS transactions” for additional information. \\n \\nA Department\\'s Role In Implementing State Finance Law \\n \\nDepartment’s are responsible for carrying out it’s mission in accordance with the Department’s enabling \\nlegislation and General and Special laws, including State Finance Law.  A Department’s mission is defined \\nby both General and Special Laws.  \\n• \\nGeneral Laws identify the Department’s enabling legislation, including the Department’s mission, \\npowers, duties, goals and responsibilities (and for certain Departments, revenue receipt and \\nexpenditure authorization).  \\n• \\nSpecial Laws provide appropriations (funding) to carry out the Department mission, with additional \\nrequirements and restrictions (e.g., specifically earmarked funds for a particular recipient or purpose, \\nand for certain Departments, revenue receipt and expenditure authorization).  \\n• \\nState Finance Law (both General and Special Laws) identifies the manner or process by which a \\nDepartment expends funds in carrying out its mission, and the potential penalties for noncompliance \\nG.L. c. 29, s. 66 – Violations of State Finance Law - Penalties.  \\n \\nRecommendations for Managing within State Finance Law \\nThe following are high level recommended steps to support compliance with State Finance Law when \\nmaking expenditure of public funds.  The Department’s Internal Controls will document detailed protocols, \\nbased upon the unique statutory mandates of a Department, that supports fiscal accountability and risk \\nmitigation.  \\n \\n• \\nDetermine: \\no \\nPlanned activity or expenditure \\no \\n“Legal” authority for planned activity or expenditure (statute, line-item, regulation) \\no \\n“Funding” sufficient to support planned activity or expenditure (line-item appropriation, \\nfederal grant or trust) \\n• \\nIdentify: \\no \\nExpenditure Classification Handbook object class (subsidiary) and object code for the \\nplanned activity or expenditure.  (If funding account subsidiarized by Legislature an object \\ncode must be selected within that subsidiary.  If not subsidiarized, select the most \\nappropriate object code for the activity or expenditure).  \\no \\nComply with applicable requirements identified for the selected object code including \\nprocurement rules, contract boilerplates and supporting documentation. \\no \\nComply with applicable CTR Regulations, policies, and job aids for activity or expenditure. \\n \\n• \\nEvaluate internal controls, ethics issues, conflicts or risks. \\n• \\nConduct purchase or disbursement in accordance with Department protocols and applicable \\nrequirements. \\n• \\nDocument decision-making and retain all supporting materials to respond to public information \\nrequests/audits in accordance with the Statewide Disposal Schedules issued by the Secretary of \\nState Records Conservation Board. . \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law Compliance Appointments and Responsibilities \\n \\nCTR maintains a database of individuals, formally appointed by a Department Head, who are responsible \\nfor the Department’s compliance with various aspects of state finance law.  CTR uses this database to \\ncommunicate information and relies on these individuals as the knowledge base of the Departments in \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 11 of 48 \\ntheir areas of expertise.  These individuals are appointments by the Department Head with very specific \\nduties.  \\n \\nThe Internal Control Officer should be responsible for ensuring that the DHSA, MMARS security, and Key \\nAppointments are up to date, both at the Department and at the Comptroller’s Office.  These \\nresponsibilities are vital for maintaining the series of reliances CTR uses to approve the warrant.  During \\nthis transition period to MMARS and with staff turnover, it is critical that Departments notify CTR promptly \\nof any changes so that we can accurately communicate information to your Department. \\n \\nDepartment Head \\nChief Fiscal Officer \\nPayroll Director \\nInternal Control Officer \\nSecurity Officer \\nMMARS/MMARS Liaison \\nGAAP Liaison \\nGeneral Counsel \\nSingle Audit Liaison \\n \\nDepartment Heads should review the list of personnel who coordinate policy and procedures on their \\nbehalf and reappoint individuals to these roles.  Please review the current list within your Department and \\nforward any changes.  For a description of the responsibilities of each individual, go to State Finance Law \\nCompliance Appointments and Responsibilities.  Each individual listed requires access to the Intranet \\n(either through access behind the firewall or through VPN access if the Department is outside the firewall) \\nin order to retrieve and process documents, policies and other information posted on the Knowledge \\nCenter and MMARS by CTR and OSD.  \\n \\nCTR will communicate important information to these individuals and will rely on these individuals as the \\nknowledge base of the Departments in their areas of expertise.  Please see also Policy chapter \\n“Department Head Signature Authorization and Electronic Signatures for MMARS transactions” for \\nadditional information. \\n \\nDelegation of MMARS transaction Processing (Transaction Delegation) \\n \\nMMARS transaction processing (transaction) delegation enables Departments to process MMARS \\nencumbrance documents for commodities and service contracts within certain dollar limits to Final status \\nwithout prior review by CTR, OSD or another state agency, provided the Department complies with CTR \\nand other identified laws, policies and procedures and the use of specified Contract Forms.  CTR and OSD \\nconduct comprehensive Quality Assurance (QA) reviews on selected procurements and contracts which are \\nalso subject to post audit by SAO, IGO, ETH and AGO. \\n \\nAs stated previously, if the Department is within the Legislative or Judicial Branch or is a non-Executive \\nDepartment or institution, agreeing to comply with state finance laws, including Comptroller laws, \\nregulations, policies and procedures will not by implication extend compliance to Executive Orders or other \\nExecutive Branch directives that this Department would not normally be subject to, unless the ability to \\nuse certain MMARS transactions, system functionality or benefits (such as transaction delegation or \\nincidental purchases) requires compliance with certain minimum requirements (such as the use of \\nstandard Commonwealth boilerplate contracts, or compliance with minimum procedures).  If a Department \\nchooses to take advantage of these benefits, the Department must comply with the minimum \\nrequirements for these benefits, unless otherwise specified. \\n \\nDepartments are afforded greater responsibility and accountability as a result of the delegation of high \\nvolume/low risk transaction encumbrance processing.  Delegation means that a Department will have \\nmore authority and responsibility in processing financial transactions and filing contracts. Increased \\nauthority includes the ability to: \\n \\n1. Process encumbrance transactions up to a certain dollar limit within the Department.  \\n2. Make incidental purchases up to a certain dollar limit without a structured procurement process or \\ncontract.  \\n3. Eliminate individual payments up to a certain dollar limit by using the Commonwealth\\'s credit card.  \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 12 of 48 \\n \\nIncreased responsibility includes creating and maintaining a management environment that: \\n1. Provides the appropriate level of review and approval of encumbrance transactions processed \\nwithin the Departments. \\n2. Provides a framework to achieve best value for incidental purchases without a structured \\nprocurement or contract. \\n3. Trusts and empowers employees to use Commonwealth credit cards for Commonwealth business, \\nthus eliminating multiple processes for incidental transactions.  \\n \\nCTR and OSD conduct comprehensive Quality Assurance (QA) reviews on selected procurements and \\ncontracts.  Contracts are also subject to post audit by SAO, IGO, ETH and AGO.  Please see Policy Chapter \\n“Delegation of MMARS Processing Authority” for additional information.  \\n \\nExpenditure Classification Handbook \\n \\nThis handbook includes the object code descriptions and instructions regarding the encumbering and \\nexpenditure of all funds.  The object codes in this Handbook are used for all expenditures of the \\nCommonwealth regardless of whether the payment is to employees, contractors, individuals, recipients, \\nbeneficiaries, political sub-divisions, etc.  Object codes fulfill tax reporting obligations and identify \\nprocurement, contract, legal authority, transaction document and other key information. \\n \\nDepartments are responsible, PRIOR to incurring an obligation, to ensure that they \\nhave identified the appropriate object class and object code for the given obligation, \\nand that they comply with identified requirements or restrictions.   \\n \\n \\nRevenues - Department Acceptance And Expenditure  \\nThe following Constitutional, General and Special Laws govern a Department’s acceptance of revenue and \\ndetermine the Department’s ability to expend that revenue: \\n• \\nMassachusetts Constitution: Article LXIII. Section 1. \"Collection of Revenue. - All money \\nreceived on account of the commonwealth from any source whatsoever shall be paid into the \\ntreasury thereof.\"  \\n• \\nG.L. c. 30, s. 27: \"Except as otherwise expressly provided, all fees or other money received on \\naccount of the commonwealth shall be paid daily into the treasury thereof.\"  \\n• \\nThis means that the total revenues collected by a Department must be deposited and \\naccounted for in the state accounting system (MMARS).  \\n• \\nIf a Contractor assists a Department in the collection of revenue (e.g., debt collection \\nagency, revenue maximization Contractor, or a cost avoidance Contractor) the total of all \\nrevenues collected must first be deposited and accounted for in the state accounting system \\nprior to payment being made to the Contractor. (i.e., no \"netting\" of revenues and fees). \\n• \\nG.L. c. 10, s. 17B Unless otherwise provided by law, all moneys received by a Department shall be \\ndeposited with the state treasurer (subject to the approval of the Governor) and expended, subject \\nto appropriation.  \\n• \\nThis means that a Department can receive funds from any source (gift, grant or bequest) \\nbut must have specific legislative authority (language) to expend the funds (subject to \\nappropriation).  \\n• \\nExamples of specific legislative authority (language) authorizing receipt and \\nexpenditure of funds include:  \\n• \\n\"…and may expend such funds without further appropriation…\", or  \\n• \\n\"…and may expend such funds for the purposes of this section…\" \\n• \\nIf a General or Special law is silent as to the ability of the Department to expend the \\nfunds, or states that expenditures are \"subject to appropriation\", the Department \\nmay not obligate or expend the funds received until the Legislature authorizes \\n(appropriates) the expenditure of fund through a GAA, SAA or other Act. \\n• \\nG.L. c. 6A, s. 6. Subject to approval of ANF, a secretary may apply for and accept funds, grants, \\nbequests, gifts or contributions, from any person and expend in accordance with law. Approval of \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 13 of 48 \\nan expendable trust by ANF is governed by 801 CMR 50.00 Expendable Trust Regulation.  Contact \\nthe Legal Division of ANF for more information. The Trust language determines how the funding \\nmay be expended.  \\n• \\nG.L. c. 29, s. 29E, 815 CMR 8.00 and annual Special Laws provide the authorization for contingent \\nfee contracts for non-tax revenue maximization and cost avoidance projects.  \\n• \\nExample of Trust established by General Law: ex. G.L. c. 29D - Health Care Security Trust  \\n• \\nExample of Retained Revenue Account established by Special Law: Chapter 159 of \\nthe Acts of 2000, section 2. ss. 1775-0900 \"The Operational Services Division may expend \\nrevenues in an amount not to exceed $100,000 collected pursuant to chapter 449 of the \\nacts of 1984… from the sale of federal surplus property\"  \\n• \\nExample of Interdepartmental Chargeback established by Special Law: Chapter 159 \\nof the Acts of 2000 section 2B. ss. 1100-1108 – \"For the office of dispute resolution for the \\ncosts of mediation and another services provided to certain agencies \\n…………………….…………………….$300,000 \\n• \\nNOTE: Irrespective of source of funding, Departments are required to encumber and expend funds \\nin accordance with state finance law requirements identified by CTR (e.g., Expenditure \\nClassification Handbook; Comptroller Knowledge Center Policies; Fiscal Year Updates and Fiscal \\nYear Closing and Opening Instructions.

The details of procurement requirements for commodities and services are found in this Policy and \\nOSD’s Procurement Information Center (PIC).  \\n  \\nThe requirements for state grants and federal subgrants, subsidies, Interdepartmental \\nService Agreements (ISAs) and Interdepartmental Chargebacks are the same for all \\nDepartments irrespective of Procurement Level.  Please see the Policy Chapter for each \\ntype of Contract for additional information and requirements. \\n \\n \\nThe following sections outline the particular requirements for commodities and services procurements for \\neach of the Department procurement levels.  \\n \\nLEVEL I: EXEMPT DEPARTMENTS  \\nLevel I Procurement Requirements – Commodity and Service Contracts \\n \\n• \\nLevel I Departments are exempt from G.L. c. 7, § 22, G.L. c. 30, § 51 and G.L. c. 30, § 52 \\nalthough Exempt Departments are encouraged to conduct procurements consistent with 801CMR \\n21.00 and the Procurement Information Center (PIC).  Level I Departments are subject to G.L. \\nc. 7A and c. 29; Comptroller law, regulations, policies and procedures, other laws, rules and \\nregulations governing the Department’s purchasing and expenditures, and the five conditions for \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 14 of 48 \\ntransaction delegation if the Department accepts (takes advantage) of transaction delegation \\n(MMARS document processing without prior CTR or OSD review). \\n \\nA Level I Department that accepts transaction delegation (takes advantage) of the ability to process \\nMMARS documents to final status without prior review by CTR, OSD or other oversight agencies, MUST \\ncomply with the following five conditions for transaction delegation (none of which can be waived):  \\n \\n• \\nThe Department must establish internal written procurement policies and procedures that, at a \\nminimum, contain the laws, rules and regulations governing the Department’s purchasing and \\nexpenditures, including reference to the requirements to comply with G.L. c. 7A and c. 29; \\nComptroller regulations, policies and procedures, \\n• \\nThe internal procurement polices must contain the requirements for the advertisement and receipt \\nof bids for commodities and services that stimulate open and public competitive procurements and \\nbest value.   \\n• \\nThe internal procurement policies must contain the requirements for approved exceptions to the \\ncompetitive procurement process, including procedures for making incidental purchases (a one \\ntime purchase or a series of purchases for a one time, non-recurring need) that may not exceed \\nthe threshold established by OSD pursuant to G.L. c. 7, § 22 when in the judgment of the \\nDepartment, it is expedient. \\n• \\nThe internal procurement policies must include a requirement for the Department to use the \\nCommonwealth contract boilerplates as follows: \\no \\nCommonwealth Terms and Conditions \\no \\nCommonwealth Standard Contract Form  \\n• \\nThe Department agrees to conduct all commodities and services purchases in accordance with \\nthese transaction delegation requirements and shall provide access to CTR and other authorized \\nDepartments for quality assurance and audit purposes. \\n \\nLEVEL II DEPARTMENTS – EXECUTIVE BRANCH - NON-EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS \\nLevel II-Procurement Requirements – Commodities and Services \\n \\n• \\nLevel II Departments are required to conduct competitive procurements consistent with G.L. c. 30, \\n§ 51 and G.L. c. 30, § 52 which state that all services and commodities shall be purchased in \\naccordance with G.L. c. 7, § 22 which outlines the procurement requirements for supplies, \\nequipment and other property of Departments.  In addition, Level II Departments are subject to \\nG.L. c. 7A and c. 29; Comptroller law, regulations, policies and procedures, other laws, rules and \\nregulations governing the Department’s purchasing and expenditures, and the five conditions for \\ntransaction delegation if the Department accepts (takes advantage) of transaction delegation \\n(MMARS document processing without prior CTR or OSD review). \\n \\n• \\nLevel II Departments are encouraged, although not required, to conduct procurements using 801 \\nCMR 21.00 and the Commonwealth’s Procurement Information Center (PIC).  \\n \\n• \\nLevel II Departments that do not conduct procurements under 801 CMR 21.00 must document \\nDepartment’s written internal procurement policies and procedures for audit purposes, and shall \\nprovide a copy upon request to CTR or OSD for purposes of secondary review of contracts or for \\nQuality Assurance review purposes. \\n \\nA Level II Department that accepts transaction delegation (takes advantage) of the ability to process \\nMMARS documents to final status without prior review by CTR, OSD or other agency, MUST comply with \\nthe following five conditions for transaction delegation, (none of which can be waived):  \\n \\n1.

The internal procurement polices must contain the requirements for the advertisement and receipt \\nof bids for commodities and services that stimulate open and public competitive procurements and \\nbest value.   \\n3. The internal procurement policies must contain the requirements for approved exceptions to the \\ncompetitive procurement process, including procedures for making incidental purchases (a one \\ntime purchase or a series of purchases for a one time, non-recurring need) that may not exceed \\nthe threshold established by OSD pursuant to G.L. c. 7, § 22 when, in the judgment of the \\nDepartment, it is expedient. \\n4. The internal procurement policies must include a requirement for the Department to use the \\nCommonwealth contract boilerplates as follows: \\no \\nCommonwealth Terms and Conditions \\no \\nCommonwealth Standard Contract Form  \\n5. The Department agrees to conduct all commodities and services purchases in accordance with \\nthese transaction delegation requirements and shall provide access to CTR and other authorized \\nDepartments for quality assurance and audit purposes. \\n \\nLEVEL III DEPARTMENTS – EXECUTIVE BRANCH – EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS \\nLevel III Procurement Requirements – Commodities and Services \\n \\nLevel III Departments are required to conduct competitive procurements consistent with G.L. c. 30, § 51 \\nand G.L. § 30,s.52, which state that all services and commodities shall be purchased in accordance with \\nG.L. c. 7, § 22, which outlines the procurement requirements for supplies, equipment and other property \\nof Departments.  \\n \\nAll Level III Departments are required to purchase commodities and services in accordance with 801 CMR \\n21.00 and the Procurement Information Center (PIC) which provides the details and procedures for \\nhow to conduct commodities and services procurements.  \\n \\nFor Level III - Executive Departments (and other Departments adopting 801 CMR 21.00), unless \\ncircumstances support an exception, purchases shall be done as either a: \\n \\n• \\nSmall Procurement (total value of procurement for duration of procurement does not exceed \\nthreshold set by OSD).  Request for Response (RFR) distributed to at least 3 potential bidders,  one \\nof which must be a certified minority or woman owned business if available;  OR \\n• \\nLarge Procurement (total value of procurement for duration of procurement does not exceed \\nthreshold set by OSD) \\no \\nRFR posted on Comm-PASS, final awards posted when complete; \\no \\nIf RFR seeks performance covered by World Trade Organization (WTO) which exceeds \\nthreshold RFR must be posted 40 days (may include days of notice on Comm-PASS of \\nforthcoming RFR posting). \\nPlease refer to the Commonwealth’s Procurement Information Center (PIC) for detailed instructions \\nrelated to purchasing and procurements of commodities and services. \\n \\n \\nConsultant Contract Requirements   \\nExecutive Departments purchasing consultant services (HH and N01-N14 and U05 object codes) have the \\nfollowing requirements under G.L. c. 29, § 29A:   \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 16 of 48 \\n• \\nSecretariat approval of a Request for the need for the consultant service (Request for Response \\n(RFR) or contract) \\n• \\na scope of services and duration of work (Request for Response (RFR); \\n• \\na written contract (Commonwealth Terms and Conditions and Commonwealth Standard Contract \\nForm); \\n• \\na resume or statement of qualifications; \\n• \\na disclosure of any other Commonwealth income (Contractor Mandatory Submission Form).   \\n• \\na disclosure of persons with a financial interest in the Contractor of more than one per cent of the \\ncapital stock of a corporation contracting to provide the services.  Pursuant to G.L. c. 7A, § 6 the \\ncomptroller requires a statement of financial interest prior to filing a contract. (Contractor \\nMandatory Submission Form). \\n• \\na work structure that recognizes that consultants may not supervise state employees and may not \\nsubstitute for state positions. \\n \\nPlease refer to the Commonwealth’s Procurement Information Center (PIC) for detailed instructions \\nrelated to consultant contracts. \\n \\nProcurement Exceptions – Commodities and Services Contracts \\n \\nFor Level III – Executive Departments, exceptions for commodities and services contracts are defined \\nunder 801 CMR 21.00 and the OSD Procurement Information Center (PIC) as follows: \\n\\uf0a7 \\nStatewide Contracts - Executive Departments must purchase from available Statewide Contracts \\nunless approval to conduct a procurement for a commodity or service available from an existing \\nstatewide contract has been requested and received in writing from OSD; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nEmergency contracts - to prevent or cure health or safety risk or substantial harm to the \\nfunctioning of government; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nInterim Contract – to prevent a lapse in performance to complete contract or until new \\nprocurement completed; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nLegislative or Legal Exemption - such as legislative earmarking, a court judgment or other legal \\nrestriction;  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nCollective Purchase - as approved by OSD; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nContract Employees - postings are similar to other employees which replaces RFR; (See section \\nbelow on Individual Contractors and Contract Employees). See also Policy “Individual Contractors – \\nContract Employees vs. Independent Contractors”. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nIncidental Purchase - small $ - one time, non-recurring need; (See section below) \\n \\nPlease refer to OSD Procurement Information Center (PIC)  for more information regarding \\nexceptions and requirements. \\n \\nLevel II (Executive Branch -Non-Executive Departments) and Level I (Exempt) Departments utilize similar \\nexceptions under internal procurement policies.  Level II and Level I Departments that choose to take \\nadvantage of Incidental Purchases, Statewide Contracts, Contract employees and Collective purchase \\noptions agree to comply with applicable policies and procedures for those options as required by CTR or \\nOSD.  Level I and II Departments do not have to utilize Statewide Contracts for commodities or services \\nwhen seeking to conduct an incidental purchase. \\n \\nIncidental Purchases \\n \\nIncidental Purchases are authorized under G.L. Chapter 7, Section 22 under the jurisdiction of the \\nPurchasing Agent (OSD).  Incidental Purchases are one-time, unanticipated, non-recurring purchases of \\ncommodities (goods) or services that are not available from a Statewide Contract.  Executive (Level III) \\nand any other Department that follows 801 CMR 21.00 for its internal procurement policy must comply \\nwith the incidental purchase requirements outlined in the OSD Procurement Information Center (PIC) \\nand the “Incidental Purchase Quick Reference Guide”.  \\n \\nNon-Executive (Level II) Department procurements of commodities and services are governed by G.L. \\nChapter 7, Section 22.  Level II Departments that do not adopt 801 CMR 21.00 as internal procurement \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 17 of 48 \\npractices must have written internal incidental purchase procedures that comply with the OSD policies and \\nprocedures for incidental purchases. \\n \\nExempt (Level I) Departments are not subject to G.L. c. 7, § 22 or the OSD policies and procedures for \\nincidental purchases.  However, the use of incidental purchases is a privilege granted to Departments \\nbased upon assurances of state finance law compliance.  As part of obtaining MMARS security Department \\nHeads certified that their Departments would comply with all applicable laws, regulation, policies and \\nprocedures.  In addition, Level I Department Heads also certified that if the Department chose to take \\nadvantage of incidental purchases the Department would comply with CTR policies related to incidental \\npurchases and MMARS transaction processing delegation.  For Level I Departments, the CTR policy for \\nincidental purchases requires any Level I Department that chooses to use incidental purchases to have \\nwritten internal incidental purchase procedures that are consistent with the “one-time, unanticipated, non-\\nrecurring“ use and dollar threshold restrictions set for incidental purchases by OSD for Executive (Level \\nIII) and Non-Executive (Level II) Departments. \\n \\nLevel I and II Departments can identify the types of commodities and services eligible for incidental \\npurchases, and the Departments will not be required to use Statewide Contracts first if available for the \\ntype of purchase required.  Incidental Purchases do not require a competitive procurement or contract.  \\nThe vendor’s invoice is the minimum necessary documentation for payment.  Ongoing or recurring \\npurchases of commodities (goods) or services (performance that recurs annually) are not Incidental \\nPurchases and must be procured using a competitive procurement.  \\n \\nThe GAE is the encumbrance for incidental purchases, although no encumbrance is necessary.  If a \\nDepartment chooses to encumber funds using a PC or CT document for incidental purchases then a \\nStandard Contract Form and Commonwealth Terms and Conditions must also be completed and retained \\nin the Department’s procurement file.  \\n \\nFor more detailed information Departments should consult the OSD Procurement Information Center \\n(PIC) and the “Incidental Purchase Quick Reference Guide”  \\n \\nDocumentation Requirements for Incidental Purchases \\n \\nPurchases which do not exceed the incidental purchase limit and are not available from a statewide \\ncontract may be done without a competitive procurement. The encumbrance transaction for incidental \\npurchases is the GAE (General Accounting Encumbrance document) and the payment transaction is the \\nINP (Incidental Payment document). For most incidental purchases, only the invoice is required. On the \\nother hand, Departments may determine it is in their best interest to execute a Commonwealth Terms and \\nConditions and Standard Contract Form. If they elect to do a CT (Contract Encumbrance document), RPO \\n(Recurring Payment Order), or PC (Commodity Purchase Order), then both of these forms are required. \\nEach Department should develop internal controls on procurement and documentation that are \\nappropriate to the nature of incidental purchases that the Department is likely to encounter. Please see \\nthe associated guidance entitled Incidental Purchasing Policy Guidance under OSD’s Procurement \\nInformation Center (PIC).. \\n \\nINDIVIDUAL CONTRACTORS – CONTRACT EMPLOYEE OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR \\n \\nThis policy, which is jointly issued by the Operational Services Division, Office of the Comptroller and \\nHuman Resources Division, highlights the differences between the two types of individual workers: \\ncontract employees and independent contractors. It provides guidance to Departments in determining \\nwhether to hire a contract employee or to contract with an independent Contractor and then provides \\nguidance pertaining to the recruitment and contract execution for contract employees. This guidance \\nincludes the Commonwealth’s three-part test, which incorporates the requirements of state and federal \\nlaw and which must be utilized by Departments in determining whether an individual is a contract \\nemployee or an independent Contractor. \\n \\nWhen a Department requires the services of an individual, it must determine, before acquiring the \\nservices, if the service is a competitive procurement exception (contract employee) or if it must conduct a \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 18 of 48 \\ncompetitive procurement (independent Contractor). In addition, when a Department has conducted a \\ncompetitive procurement, which was not specifically for the services of an individual but which has \\nresulted in the selection of an individual, the Department must review the specific working circumstances \\nof the contract and the individual\\'s work status to determine if the individual will be deemed a contract \\nemployee or independent Contractor in their working relationship with the Department. \\n \\nFor more detailed guidance for determining whether to hire a contract employee or to contract with an \\nindependent Contractor, and guidance pertaining to the recruitment and contract execution for contract \\nemployees, See the policy Chapter under either “Contracts” or “Payroll” for  “Individual Contractors – \\nContract Employee vs. Independent Contractor”. \\n \\nEmployment Status Form (Combined State and Federal Tests for Employment Status) \\n \\nAn Employment Status Form has been developed to assist Departments in two ways:  \\n1. To make the determination PRIOR to the procurement of services, as to whether the type of work \\nto be performed will trigger an employment relationship (contract employee) or a non-employment \\nrelationship (independent Contractor) in order to determine the proper procurement method to be \\nused to acquire the services, and \\n \\n2. To confirm the employment status when a contract is signed with an individual Contractor selected \\nfrom either an RFR (independent Contractor) or posting (contract employee), which is a required \\nattachment to the Standard Contract Form. \\n \\nThe checklist on the Employment Status Form reconciles the Federal IRS 20 factors (which are focused \\nprimarily on whether an employee falls under the “supervision and control” of a Department) with the \\nstricter Massachusetts presumption that an individual will be considered a contract employee “unless” the \\nindividual passes all three parts of the Massachusetts three-part test. \\n \\nWhile the IRS factors consider the work context and the overall balance of the 20 factors, the \\nMassachusetts law requires that the employer/employee relationship be definitively established. The \\nMassachusetts Attorney General has interpreted this test to be rigid, thus resulting in the presumption \\nthat an individual Contractor will be considered a contract employee unless the three-part test under G.L. \\nc. 149, s. 148B is met. The burden is on the Department to defend a determination of independent \\nContractor status.  Massachusetts law imposes strict penalties when a worker is misclassified.  Therefore, \\na Department must complete the “Employment Status Form” in order to certify the status for all individual \\ncontractors and attach it to the Standard Contract Form. \\n \\nThe Employment Status Form is available under Forms-Payroll and LCM in the CTR Website and \\nas part of the policy “Individual Contractors – Contract Employee vs. Independent Contractor”. \\n \\nPosting or Procurement? \\n \\nA Department does not always know in advance whether services can be best performed by an individual \\nContractor or by a company or firm. Therefore, whenever services are being performed, the Department \\nshould make the following determinations: \\n \\n1. Identify the Business Needs of the Department: The hiring Department should develop \\nperformance specifications for the services necessary to meet the Department’s business needs, \\nincluding where the work needs to be performed, the level of control and supervision that will be \\nrequired for performance, whether the work hours or schedule will be set by the Department or the \\nContractor, whether the work is performed as part of or outside the usual course of business of the \\nDepartment. \\n \\n2. Apply the Commonwealth Three-Part Test to the Business Needs: (Employment Status \\nForm): The Department must determine if the type of work to be performed can be performed by a \\nfirm or an individual and if the type of oversight relationship will trigger an employer-employee \\nrelationship or that of an independent Contractor. To make this determination, the Department must \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 19 of 48 \\nreview the Employment Status Form to determine if an employer-employee relationship will be \\ncreated if an individual is selected for performance, as follows: \\n \\na. \\nIf the work can be performed by a firm or an individual, or the Department is unsure of how best to \\nperform the requisite service, and the review of the Employment Status Form 3-part test indicates \\nthat there will not be an employer-employee relationship, the Department is required to conduct a \\nprocurement for these services. See How to Do a Competitive Procurement in the OSD \\nProcurement Information Center (www.mass.gov/osd). \\n \\nb. \\nIf the work can only be performed by an individual, and the review of the Employment Status Form \\n3-part test indicates that there will be an employer-employee relationship, the Department is \\nrequired to post the contract notice for a contract employee, as outlined below. \\n \\nCommonwealth Three-Part Test \\n \\nCurrent employment law establishes separate tests for determining employment status under both state \\nand federal law. State law, G.L. c. 149, s. 148B, establishes a three-part test that presumes an individual \\nis a contract employee unless: \\n \\n1. The individual is free from control and direction in connection with the performance of the service, \\nboth under his contract for the performance of service and in fact. \\n \\n2. The service is performed outside the usual course of the business of the employer. \\n \\n3. The individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or \\nbusiness of the same nature as that involved in the service performed. \\n \\nThis test is a much stricter test than the federal IRS SS-8 test, which Departments have used in the past \\nto determine employment status. Any individuals who were classified as independent contractors using the \\nSS-8 test should be reassessed to determine whether they are also independent contractors under the \\nCommonwealth’s laws. If the individual would be classified as an independent Contractor under the SS-8 \\ntest, but as a contract employee under the Commonwealth Three-Part test, the individual should be \\nreclassified as a contract employee. The Attorney General’s Office may impose penalties if the three-part \\ntest shows that an individual should be a contract employee, and the individual was misclassified as an \\nindependent Contractor. \\n \\n \\nContract Employees (Procurement Exception Under 801 CMR 21.05(6)) \\n \\nThe hiring of contract employees is a competitive procurement exception under 801 CMR 21.05(6) since \\nindividuals deemed contract employees will be hired under the normal personnel procedures of the \\nDepartment.  \\n \\nDetermine the compensation of the contract: Departments should determine the rate or range of \\ncompensation based on the performance and qualifications requirements and available funding.  \\nDepartments may adjust the rate or range to reflect to lack of fringe benefits for contract employees and \\nthe selected candidate’s qualifications.  Then, Departments should determine the total compensation for \\nthe anticipated contract duration. \\n \\nPost the contract notice: Departments should post, advertise or solicit contract candidates as deemed \\nappropriate, e.g., colleges and universities, newspapers, trade journals, electronically (MassCareers), and \\nin accordance with any internal procedures on recruitment developed for the Department. The posting \\nshould include the description of performance requirements or functions, any minimum qualifications, the \\ncompensation rate or range, expected duration and possible options to renew. It should also include \\ninstructions for how and when candidates should respond to the posting. \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 20 of 48 \\nSelect the Contractor: Selection of a contract employee should be in accordance with the Department’s \\nstandard interview process. The evaluation should take into account the performance requirements and \\nminimum qualifications of the posting. See HRD’s Model Hiring Plan, Structured Interview Guidelines. See \\nthe Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination Pre-Employment Inquiries Fact Sheet for additional \\ninformation on appropriate interview questions and topics. \\n \\nContract Forms.  Contract employees must execute the Commonwealth Terms and Conditions and the \\nStandard Contract Form.  The attachments should include a copy of the contract posting or an alternative \\nattachment containing the description of the contract performance, any minimum qualifications, the \\ncompensation rate or range and a copy of the Contractor’s résumé (or statement of qualifications).  \\nInclude completed Employment Status Form.   \\n \\nAmendments.  After contract execution, annual or other options to renew or amendments to the contract \\nare exercised at the Department’s option in accordance with the duration listed in the posting by executing \\na Standard Contract Amendment Form prior to the termination date of the contract.   \\n \\nPayroll System Requirements for Contract Employees.   \\n \\n• \\nContract employees must be paid through the state payroll system that automatically makes tax \\ndeductions and alternative retirement contributions. \\n• \\nContract employees are subject to alternative retirement contributions under COBRA 1990. \\n• \\nContract employee labor will be distributed the same way regular employee labor is distributed.  By \\ndefault, all charges will be attributed to the HR/CMS position accounting line (Department, Unit, and \\nAppropriation).  If the position distribution needs to be changed or additional data needs to be \\ncaptured for labor history reporting, a default distribution, pay period exception, or labor adjustment \\nshould be created in LCM. Contract employee payroll payments will be incorporated into LCM \\npredictive/production payroll reports so that Departments can monitor and manage funded/unfunded \\npayroll accounts. LCM Labor History and CIW reports can be used to track contract employee payroll \\nexpenses. \\n• \\nThe Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) makes it illegal for an employer to hire an \\nunauthorized worker.  Employers must comply with this requirement by verifying the identity and right \\nto work of all employees hired after November 6, 1986.  Prior to hiring any individual, employers can \\nprotect themselves by obtaining proof of the right to work in the U.S. This proof of right to work is \\nknown as Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification. This form is available at: Form I-9, \\nEmployment Eligibility Verification. \\n• \\nMake sure the name matches Social Security Administration records.  Correct names and social \\nsecurity numbers (SSN) on W-2 wage reports are the keys to successful processing of the \\nCommonwealth’s annual wage report submission. Not only can the Commonwealth be subject to \\npenalties when employee names and SSNs don\\'t match Social Security Administration records, but \\nalso unmatched wage reports can cause earnings that are not posted to your employees\\' records. To \\nverify the name and SSN match, call the SSA toll-free number for employers - 1-800-772-6270 \\nprovide Social Security Number, Date of Birth and Gender. The Commonwealth EIN is 04-6002284. \\nDouble check to make sure you have entered the SSN correctly into the payroll system. \\n• \\nUpon hiring or rehiring an individual verify Medicare Status. For Rehires verify that a ‘break in service’ \\nhas not occurred. Validate Income and Medicare taxes are appropriately withheld from wages paid to \\ncontract employees, in amounts determined by the employees’ withholding certificates and \\ngovernmental withholding tax tables”. \\n• \\nContract employees receive a W-2 for state and federal tax purposes.   \\n \\nMassachusetts Labor Relations Commission Test: \\n \\nFor the purposes of determining collective bargaining status, the Massachusetts Labor Relations \\nCommission does not distinguish between a contract employee and an independent Contractor.  Only \\nthose individuals who meet the Labor Relations Commission’s standard of independent Contractor will be \\nexempt from the definition of employee pursuant to G.L. c. 150E and, as such, exempt from union \\nmembership.  In determining whether an employee is an independent Contractor, the Labor Relations \\nCommission examines whether the alleged employer retains control over the worker.  In analyzing the \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 21 of 48 \\ncontrol issue, the Labor Relations Commission examines the duties of the workers, the type of supervision \\nthey receive, how the employer treats the workers, and the method in which the workers are paid.  The \\nfunding source for the position is irrelevant to the Labor Relations Commission’s analysis. \\n \\n \\nFixed Assets – Acquisition Policy and Procurement Considerations when purchasing durable \\ncommodities (applies to all Departments) \\n \\nUnless otherwise specified, the policies identified for the acquisition of fixed assets including durable \\ncommodities apply to all branches of state government.  Acquisition includes cash purchase, receipt of a \\ndonation, construction, rental, license, term lease, lease purchase (TELP) or eminent domain, regardless \\nof the source of funds used.  All acquisitions of fixed assets must be recorded in accordance with existing \\nlaws and policies of the Commonwealth.  The Commonwealth owns an asset when the full title of the asset \\nrests with the Commonwealth.  \\n \\n \\nAll purchases of commodities such as furniture, vehicles, equipment, computer \\nsoftware, electrical and computer components with a value exceeding $1,000 must be \\nrecorded as inventory and when exceeding $50,000 must be recorded as fixed assets \\nin MMARS.   \\n \\nDepartment must comply with Fixed Asset - Acquisition Policy for these types of \\npurchases, and for guidance on the appropriate considerations for rentals, leases, \\noutright purchases and Tax Exempt Lease Purchases (TELPs). \\n \\n \\nThe cost of purchasing an asset includes all costs necessary to put that asset into existing use and \\nlocation, including but not limited to freight, insurance and installation (i.e., ancillary costs). These costs \\nmay include legal costs, eminent domain costs or environmental remediation. The custodial responsibilities \\nof an asset will reside within a particular Department.  All GAAP fixed asset transactions must be entered \\nin MMARS. \\n \\nThe Fixed Asset – Acquisition Policy outlines the requirements that apply to fixed assets, including \\nprocurement considerations and recording responsibilities.  Departments that purchase durable \\ncommodities are required to conduct these purchases in accordance with the relevant procurement \\nrequirements AND the Fixed Asset Acquisition Policy.  Please see Policy Chapter “Fixed Asset – \\nAcquisition Policy for additional information and requirements. \\n \\nSTATE GRANTS AND FEDERAL SUBGRANTS PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS. \\nA formal public notice of a grant application will be required under 815 CMR 2.00 whenever a Department \\nplans to disburse discretionary grant funding of state appropriated funds which do not specifically \\nidentify the grant recipients to receive funding and: \\na. the total anticipated value of any single grant award may exceed $50,000 for the duration of \\nthe grant or grant program, or \\nb. the pool of potential eligible grant recipients includes, or may include, non-public entities, or \\nc. the total available funds for disbursement in any fiscal year exceeds $200,000;  \\nunless the grant meets an authorized exception.   \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nLegislative or Legal Exemption - earmarked or designated grantees; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nIncidental Grants - small $ - one time, non-recurring grants; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nInterim Grant - to complete performance or to prevent a lapse in performance until a new grant \\napplication process is completed; \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 22 of 48 \\n\\uf0a7 \\nBest value –a formal posting on Comm-PASS or other pubic posting of a Notice of Intent to Award \\na grant(s) on Comm-PASS with justification of why the selection of the grantee(s) without a \\nprocurement is the best value common sense decision, as efficient, fair and reasonable and in the \\nbest interests of the Department and the Commonwealth. \\n \\nState and Federal Subgrants are subject to all other contract and accounting requirements as any other \\ncontract. Federal Subgrants may have additional federal reporting and federal grant requirements.   \\nPlease see Policy Chapter “Contracts – State Grants and Federal Sub-grants”.  Procurement \\nexceptions do not apply to Subsidies, ISAs and Chargebacks. Please see Chapters for each Contract type \\nfor additional information regarding procurement exceptions.   \\n \\nRequirements for Vendors Receiving Federal Funds (DUNS Numbers) \\n \\nThe United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires all vendors (defined as sole \\nproprietor, corporation, profit and non-profit, partnership municipal or regional government, that receive \\nfederal grant funds have their Dunn and Bradstreet Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number \\nrecorded with and subsequently reported by the granting agency.  To meet this requirement, the MA-W-9 \\nForm includes the field DUNS number.  All vendors must submit their DUNS number using the form MA-W-\\n9.  Any entity that does not have a DUNS number can apply for one on-line at www.DNB.com under the \\n“D&B D-U-N-Number” Tab or at: \\nhttps://eupdate.dnb.com/requestoptions.asp?cm_re=HomepageB*TopNav*DUNSNumberTab.  Individuals \\ncannot obtain and do not need a DUNS number,. i.e., foster parents who are paid using their social \\nsecurity number.  Departments should enter or update using a Vendor/Customer Entry (VCC) or a Vendor \\nCustomer Modification (VCM). \\n \\nUse of the Commonwealth DUNS numbers by non-Commonwealth entities is Prohibited – \\nIssuance of the Commonwealth’s DUNS numbers to non-Commonwealth entities such as sub-recipients \\nis prohibited.  If this is done, the Commonwealth may be put into a position of being reported as being \\nprimarily responsible for a secondary entity’s activities.  See The Use of DUNS Numbers in Federal Grants \\nPolicy.  If a Contractor has multiple DUNS numbers, the Contractor should provide the primary number \\nlisted with the Federal government’s Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at: http://www.ccr.gov. \\n \\nFederal Grant Funding  \\n \\nSpecial requirements must be met when accepting and expending federal grant funds, including disbursing \\nfederal grant funds through a federal subgrant or through an Interdepartmental Service Agreement (ISA).  \\nDepartments are required to carefully follow cost accounting requirements for coding federal grants.  See \\nFederal Grants and Cost Accounting Page on the web site for applicable policies, job aids and document \\nprofiles.  See the policy chapters on “State Grants and Federal Subgrants” and “Interdepartmental \\nService Agreements (ISAs)” for additional information and requirements for use of federal grant \\nfunding \\n. \\nCONTRACT EXECUTION AND FILING \\nThe following sections identify the requirements for the use of contracts, contract execution, filing, and \\ncontract management.  \\n \\nTypes of Contracts \\n \\nThe following is a listing of the most common types of contracts. This section contains many of the general \\nrequirements that apply to these types of contracts (with the exception of construction and real property \\nleases.)  Please see the Contracts Policy Chapter for each contract type for additional requirements and \\ninformation.  The Expenditure Classification Handbook identifies the required Contract Form to be used for \\neach object code, if applicable. \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nSubsidies (Non-discretionary Legislatively Mandated Payment to Specified Recipient(s)) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nCommodities and Services (Including Health and Human Services, Leases, TELPS, Consultant \\nContracts, Incidental Purchases and Statewide Contracts) \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 23 of 48 \\n\\uf0a7 \\nGrants and Federal Subgrants (including Federal Subgrants and Incidental Grants) (Financial \\nAssistance for a Public Purpose) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nInterdepartmental Service Agreements (Joint Venture between Departments) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nInterdepartmental Chargebacks (Legislatively authorized service fees or charges) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nHorizontal Construction Contracts (Roads, bridges) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nVertical Construction Contracts (Buildings) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nReal Property Leases (Space or land leases) \\n \\nContract Forms \\n \\nAll Level II and Level III Departments, and any Level I Departments that take advantage of MMARS \\ntransaction processing delegation (transaction delegation) are required to use standard Commonwealth \\ncontract boilerplates.  The following are the most common standard Commonwealth contract boilerplates.  \\nPlease see Policy Chapters for each type of Contract for additional requirements and information.  Forms \\nare available under the Procurement/Contract Page under “Forms”: \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nCommonwealth Terms and Conditions Form \\n\\uf0a7 \\nCommonwealth Terms and Conditions for Human and Social Services (Level III - Executive Only) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nCommonwealth Standard Contract Form \\n\\uf0a7 \\nPurchase Order for Commodities and/or Services \\n\\uf0a7 \\nChange in Contractor Identify Form (Change in business structure or contract assignment)  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nInterdepartmental Service Agreement Form \\n\\uf0a7 \\nSubsidy Agreement \\n\\uf0a7 \\nConstruction Contracts (vertical) and Real Property Leasing see the Division of Capital Asset \\nManagement Forms.   \\n \\nContract Form Exceptions \\nThere are a few exceptions to the general requirement of using Commonwealth boilerplate contracts.  \\nThese circumstances are rare and should be negotiated sparinG.L.y, as follows: \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAlternative contracts are acceptable for student interns.  Although primarily an issue with \\nhigher education institutions which routinely employ student interns as part of normal business and \\nas part of work study curriculum, any Department may use an alternative contract form for student \\ninterns.  If the student is covered by G.L. c. 258, the commonwealth has some protection, \\nhowever, a contract which offers liability protection and requires the student to comply with \\nDepartment policies and procedures in accordance with law is sufficient.  Departments are \\nencouraged to review alternative student intern contracts with CTR and/or OSD for comments. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAlternative contracts are acceptable for contracts with the federal government.  The \\nfederal government, when performing contract work for the Commonwealth, routinely refuses to \\nsign the Commonwealth boilerplates.  Upon review of Department legal counsel and CTR and/or \\nOSD counsel, a Department may develop its own alternative form to memorialize performance \\nrequirements or sign a form prescribed by the federal government.  Agreements with quasi-federal \\nentities are not included within this exception. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAlternative contracts are acceptable for contracts with multi-state collaboratives.  In \\nsome cases, a Department will be one of several states included in a multi-state, or state-federal \\ncollaborative.  In these circumstances the Department may execute an alternative contract or \\nMemorandum of Understanding, provided the document has been reviewed by Department counsel \\nand CTR and/or OSD to ensure that signature would not bind the Commonwealth to obligations in \\nviolation of state law, or attempt to obligate the Commonwealth to appropriate funds in a future \\nfiscal year(s) for the collaborative. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nWaiver of use of contract in emergency or special circumstances.  In certain very rare \\ncircumstances, a waiver of the use of a contract may be necessary.  For example, in emergency, \\ncritical need or exceptional circumstances as outlined in 801 CMR 21.08 (2) funding for emergency \\nor special performance it is anticipated that a contract will be executed with the Contractor \\nproviding the emergency service.  In the event a contract can not be executed by the parties \\ncontemporaneously with the need for the performance, the Department shall not be required to \\nretroactively attempt to have a contract signed.  Instead, the Department shall follow the contract \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 24 of 48 \\nsettlement and release process.  This remedy should not be assumed to be a routine remedy for \\nadministrative failure to obtain timely executed contracts, and use of settlements will be strictly \\nreviewed as part of quality assurance reviews by CTR and OSD, and will be subject to audit.  This \\nsection applies to any type of contract. \\n \\nProhibition against Execution of Vendor Contracts \\n \\nCTR and OSD support the Office of the Attorney General’s recommendation against the execution of any \\nvendor or contract boilerplate, or the acceptance of vendor invoices or purchase orders with contractual \\nterms.  Many of these forms contain terms which contradict standard Commonwealth boilerplate terms, \\nprovide a benefit to the vendor to the detriment of the Commonwealth, restrict the AGO’s ability to \\nsuccessfully defend or litigate on behalf of the Commonwealth or severely limit contract recoveries for \\nbreach of contract.   \\n \\nThe AGO has approved the use of the Commonwealth Terms and Conditions (T&C and T&C HHS) for the \\nuse by Commonwealth Departments as well as other listed Commonwealth boilerplates.  A vendor \\ncontract may be attached unsigned to a Commonwealth contract if the document contains relevant \\nperformance requirements, however, conflicting terms should be crossed out.  Even if terms are not \\ncrossed out, conflicting terms will be superseded by the Commonwealth contract terms.   \\n \\nDepartments are strongly advised not to execute vendor contracts, even if a vendor requests signature \\nin return for the vendor’s signature of the Commonwealth contracts.  Departments may be faced with \\nunusual circumstances in which a Contractor refuses to sign the Commonwealth contracts, conditions the \\nsignature on material changes to the contract, or demands the Commonwealth’s signature on a vendor \\nContractor or the vendor will not provide performance.  These circumstances should be immediately \\ncommunicated to the Department’s legal office for resolution.   \\n \\nThe issue of vendor contracts arises more often when Departments are procuring incidental purchases in \\nwhich no procurement or contract is required (such as being required to execute a rental contract for a \\nshort term rental of equipment, furniture or space.)  Even though a Commonwealth contract boilerplate is \\nnot required, this does not mean that signing a vendor contract is acceptable.  On the contrary, if any \\ncontract is used, it must be a Commonwealth boilerplate, not a vendor contract.  Since Departments are \\nultimately in control of their business decisions, Departments that choose to execute a vendor contract, \\nunder any circumstance, assume any risks, costs or liabilities associated with this decision and the AGO \\nmay choose not to represent the Department in any resulting litigation.   \\n \\nInsurance and Indemnification \\n \\nDepartments are prohibited from insuring Commonwealth property under G.L. c. 29, § 30 absent specific \\nlegislative authorization.  This means that a Department is prohibited from insuring its property or \\nequipment from damage or loss.  The Commonwealth is \"self-insured\", which means that it does not \\npurchase separate personal and property liability insurance, but pays for damages through its own funding \\nappropriated by the Legislature. \\n \\nIn addition to being prohibited from insuring its own property, a Department may not insure property it \\ndoes not own (lease or TELP).  The leasing company is responsible for insuring any property it owns and \\nleases to the Commonwealth.  The leasing company may calculate a lease payment to include its cost for \\nhaving insurance, but may not tack on a separate fee for insurance, or require a Department to obtain \\nseparate insurance for leased property.   \\n \\nMassachusetts employees are covered under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act under G.L. c. 258 which \\ncovers liability for personal and property damages caused by the Commonwealth in the course of its \\nofficial duties.  Claims that are properly presented and finalized are paid by the Commonwealth in \\naccordance with this statute, subject to appropriation and available funds in the Liability Management \\nReduction  Fund (created under G.L. c. 7A, § 16.   \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 25 of 48 \\nVendors requesting that the Commonwealth provide an insurance policy or purchase insurance for an \\nevent, equipment, etc. should be informed that the Commonwealth is self-insured and does not pay for \\nadditional insurance.  The Commonwealth does not provide certificates or other proof of insurance since \\nthis is provided for in the statute G.L. c. 258 (which has the same affect).  Therefore, providing this \\ninformation should obviate the need for providing further proof of insurance. \\n \\nThe Massachusetts Constitution mandates that all claims for money due and owing are \"subject to \\nappropriation\".  Any language in a contract which attempts to obligate the Commonwealth to indemnify or \\notherwise obligate the Commonwealth to pay damages at some future date (in advance of an \\nappropriation) is deemed void.  Therefore, no contract may contain language obligating the \\nCommonwealth to pay damages or to indemnify a Contractor (absent legislative language to the contrary) \\nwithout an appropriation.  The Commonwealth Terms and Conditions contains language stating that \\ncontractors may be indemnified “in accordance with law”, which means that if the Commonwealth is found \\nliable for a breach or other damages that are awarded to a Contractor through litigation or other contract \\nclaim, the Contractor will be paid “subject to appropriation” by the Legislature.  There can be no \\nguaranteed entitlement to indemnification or damages.  A Contractor must always file a claim and prove \\ndamages. \\n \\nThese restrictions do not prohibit a Department from negotiating as part of a contract an amount or \\ncalculation of liquidated damages that could be paid, subject to appropriation, in the event certain \\ndamages occurred and were proven by a Contractor.  This language would be binding only as to the \\n“amount” or “calculation” to be used if damages are proven, and would not be binding upon the \\nCommonwealth as an entitlement to payment.  There is still no guarantee of payment since the Contractor \\nmust still bring a claim for damages, and the Contractor must prove damages, and any payment for \\nsubstantiated damages would be subject to appropriation by the Legislature.    \\n \\nDepartments may not negotiate language that limits the Commonwealth’s right to indemnification or limits \\na Contractor’s liability for damages, except as authorized in the Standard Contract Form.  The Attorney \\nGeneral’s Office has determined, as the Authorized Attorney for the Commonwealth, that the right to full \\nrecoupment of contract damages and personal and property damage to the Commonwealth is required \\nand may not be reduced, except as authorized under the “Limitation of Liability for Information \\nTechnology Contracts” section of the Standard Contract Form.  \\n \\nAttempts to reduce the Commonwealth’s rights to indemnification or reducing a Contractor’s liability for \\ndamages shifts the risk of loss from the Contractor (who is in a better position to insure for these \\ndamages) to the Commonwealth.  In the event of a loss, the Commonwealth would need to cover the \\nlosses with appropriated dollars and might not be able to recoup the full extent of damages caused by the \\nContractor.  Insuring for contract damages, and for personal and property damages to the Commonwealth \\nare a normal business expense that is properly borne by a Contractor and which are costs that are \\nprorated across all contracts a Contractor has, not just the Commonwealth contracts.  Therefore, having \\nsufficient insurance to cover damages should already be factored into contract pricing and Departments \\nshould be wary of Contractors claiming that having this insurance “costs the Commonwealth more money” \\nsince this type of insurance should be already be in place for all Contractor customers.  .  \\n   \\nSee Contract Negotiation section below.   \\n \\nQuestions on insurance or indemnification should always be referred to the Department’s legal counsel.  \\n \\nContract Attachments \\n \\nContract attachments and contents vary depending upon the type of contract.  Please see the policy \\nchapter for each type of contract for details regarding contents and attachments.  Please see also the \\nPolicy Chapter “Quick Reference – Commodities and Services, Grants, Subsidies, ISAs and \\nChargebacks” and the “Quick Reference” for each of the contract types.  Contracts must be filed as \\nprescribed by the Comptroller.  \\n \\nCompetitive Procurements: \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 26 of 48 \\n\\uf0a7 \\nRequest for Response (RFR); Copy of the RFR or screen print of the Comm-PASS Contract \\nSummary tab containing the RFR title and reference number, or other solicitation document. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nContractor response to RFR or response to other solicitation document \\n \\nProcurement Exceptions: \\n\\uf0a7 \\nSupporting documentation justifying procurement exception (Note:  documentation must explain \\nthe authority for the exception, include the cite and language of any statutory or legal exemption, \\nand the circumstances supporting the exception.  For exceptions other than a legislative earmark \\nspecifically naming the Contractor and amount, a detailed justification detailing all the \\ncircumstances of the exception and why the contract is appropriate must be attached. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nDetailed Scope of performance and budget.  A single line scope or budget is not sufficient.  \\nPerformance expectations, dates for performance, reporting, and other details of performance must \\nbe included. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nCopy of posting and resume (Contract Employees) \\n \\nOther attachments:  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nEmployment Status Form (required for all Contracts with Individuals) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nContractor Authorized Signatory Listing (all)  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nConsultant Contractor Mandatory Submission Form  (consultant Contracts – HH, N01-N14 and U05 \\nObject Codes – Level II-Non-Executive and Level III – Executive) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nHuman and Social Service Contract Attachments (Level III – Executive Only) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nPurchase Order for Commodities and/or Services (located on the OSD Forms page) or an \\nequivalent to confirm the selection of equipment and services, if the specific terms are not already \\nincluded as part of the contract. Any terms and conditions and/or agreements included in or \\nattached to the form that differ from or are in addition to the terms and conditions of the contract \\nare superseded and shall be deemed void. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nOther attachments required by OSD (See Procurement Information Center (PIC); or required by \\nthe Department or under the procurement \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAdditional negotiated terms not in conflict with RFR or Contract terms. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nJustification Statements or supporting documentation for amendments, why a Prompt Pay Discount \\nis not be taken for accelerated payments (See Bill Payment Policy) or other justifications for \\nprocurement exceptions, emergency contracts, interim contracts or any other deviation from the \\nnormal procurement or contracting process, or other relevant information for quality assurance or \\naudit purposes.    \\n \\nOther Required Contract Forms. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nFORM W-9 (MASSACHUSETTS SUBSTITUTE W-9 FORM if Contractor not registered as vendor in \\nMMARS Vendor/Customer file \\n\\uf0a7 \\nElectronic Funds Transfer (EFT) form (all, unless one-time payment or hardship)  \\n \\n \\nContract Negotiation \\nThe following negotiation terms reference 801 CMR 21.00 but are incorporated by reference herein and \\napply to all contracts using the Commonwealth Terms and Conditions and Standard Contract Form. \\n \\nThe identification of a selected bidder(s) or a grant award do not create a contractual obligation on the \\nDepartment or the Commonwealth until negotiations have been successfully concluded and a contract has \\nbeen executed by both parties. The following sections provide guidance on negotiating contracts with \\nselected bidders. Departments are encouraged to include programmatic, Affirmative Market Program \\nCoordinators or their designees and fiscal and legal staff during contract negotiations. \\n \\nIn addition, Departments should remember that, pursuant to G.L. c. 106, s. 2-205, bidders’ \\nresponses/bids made in response to a Request for Response will only remain in effect for 90 days from the \\ndate of bid submission. If it appears during contract negotiations that the negotiations may cause this 90 \\nday effective bid period to lapse, then the Procurement Management Team should ask the bidder to renew \\ntheir bid proposal in writing. \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 27 of 48 \\nWhat Is Negotiable? \\n \\nPursuant to 801 CMR 21.07(1), the PMT may negotiate with selected bidder(s) prior to execution of a \\ncontract based on what was specified in the RFR.  The Standard Contract Form identifies the following \\nhierarchy or order of precedence of documents:  \\n \\n1. the applicable Commonwealth Terms and Conditions, \\n2. the Standard Contract Form including the Instructions and Contractor Certifications,  \\n3. the Request for Response (RFR) or other solicitation, \\n4. the Contractor’s Response, and additional negotiated terms,  \\n5. provided that additional negotiated terms will take precedence over the relevant terms in the RFR \\nand the Contractor’s Response only if made using the process outlined in  801 CMR 21.07, \\nincorporated herein, provided that any amended RFR or Response terms result in best value, lower \\ncosts, or a more cost effective Contract. \\n \\n801 CMR 21.07 (1(a) and (b) allow additional terms and clarifications to take precedence over the original \\nRFR and Contractor’s Response ONLY if the terms do not change the boilerplate terms of the contracts \\n(specifically or by implication) and are within the scope of the RFR and Contractor’s Response.   \\n \\nThe better value standard described in 801 CMR 21.07(1)(c) allows the Department and a selected bidder, \\nor a Contractor, to negotiate a change in any element of contract performance or cost identified in the RFR \\nor the bidder’s response which results in lower costs, or a more cost-effective or better value commodity \\nor service than was presented in the bidder’s original selected response.  The additional terms will take \\nprecedence over the terms in the RFR or Contractor’s Response provided the terms do not change the \\nboilerplate terms of the contracts (specifically or by implication) and results in a better value than \\nidentified in the RFR and Contractor’s Response. \\n \\nAffirmative Market Program (AMP) Plan Negotiations: Prior to signing a contract, agencies may negotiate \\nthe AMP Plan and benchmark for spending with SOMWBA certified M/WBEs for the duration of the \\ncontract, but only to increase what was committed to in the original response. Please see the Affirmative \\nMarket Program guidance for more information pertaining to AMP plan negotiations. Negotiated changes \\nmust be included in the procurement file. \\n \\nAdditional Negotiated Items Agreed to by Both Parties: Pursuant to 801 CMR 21.07(1)(b), the PMT and a \\nselected bidder, or a Contractor, may negotiate additional language which clarifies their understanding of, \\nbut does not change, the language of the contract or contract performance identified in the original RFR \\nand a bidder’s response. These clarifications may provide a more detailed description of the language in \\nan RFR and the response. They may also provide additional terms and the meaning of terms in the \\napplicable Commonwealth Terms and Conditions and the Standard Contract Form. Clarifications may fill in \\nthe gaps and “spell-out” the understanding of the Department and the Contractor regarding their \\nrespective contract responsibilities. Clarifications may not be used to have the effect of negating, \\nmodifying or replacing language in the applicable Commonwealth Terms and Conditions and the Standard \\nContract Form. The following are examples of acceptable clarifications or additions to a contract, which \\nclarify, but do not change, the intent of the contract language or the rights of the Department: \\n \\nAcceptable Clarifications \\n• \\nFor the purposes of this contract, the term “records” in the contract shall include performance \\nrecords with the dates and times of all service calls, the reasons for the calls and how these \\nwere resolved. \\n• \\nFor the purposes of this contract, “normal wear” shall mean natural forces acting upon \\nequipment while it is operated within product specifications. Normal wear shall not include \\nnegligence, misuse, external forces or the use of commodities or services that are not \\ncompatible with the Contractor’s stated specifications. \\n• \\nThe Contractor and Department agree that “notice” under this contract may be delivered initially \\nby fax but shall not be effective until the date of postmark of First Class Postage Prepaid, \\naddressed to the contract manager of either party at the address listed in the contract. \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 28 of 48 \\nAcceptable Clarifications \\n• \\nThe Contractor agrees, pursuant to negotiations, to supply a newer, more advanced model of \\nthe commodity procured pursuant to this RFR for the same price as the Contractor’s bid price, \\nwhich provides better value to the Commonwealth. \\n \\nThe following selected examples are not acceptable clarifications or additions to a contract since they \\nmaterially change the intent of the contract language and the rights of the Department: \\n \\nUnacceptable Clarifications \\n• \\nFor the purpose of this contract, the term “Contractor” shall not include subcontractors. \\n• \\nThe Contractor shall not be responsible for delays in performance or negligence of a \\nsubcontractor. \\n• \\nPursuant to the certification which states that “The Contractor represents that it is qualified to \\nprovide the performance specified in the contract and possesses or shall obtain all requisite \\nlicenses and permits,” shall be modified by adding at the beginning of this sentence, “To the \\nbest of its knowledge and belief.” \\n• \\nThe section entitled “Indemnification” in the Commonwealth Terms and Conditions shall be \\ndeleted and replaced with the following language, “[any alternative language of bidder...].” \\n• \\nThe Contractor may change the costs in the cost section at any time without prior notice. \\n \\nWhat Is Not Negotiable? A Department may not negotiate the terms or a change to the Standard Contract \\nForm or the applicable Commonwealth Terms and Conditions. Acceptance of any other bidder-submitted \\nstandard form or contract should not be construed as a Department’s approval of any conflicting language \\nthat may be on these documents.  \\n \\nThe Office of the Attorney General has recommended that Departments not sign additional bidder-\\nsubmitted contracts, invoices, or other documents containing contractual terms. Departments that choose \\nto sign these types of documents do so at their own risk and are responsible for any associated costs, \\nlegal representation or damages. \\n \\nIn certain circumstances, however, the PMT may wish to consult with the OSD Legal Bureau regarding \\nsoftware license agreements or other contractual issues. In addition, Departments may not negotiate for \\nany new commodities or services that are outside the scope of the original RFR. \\n \\nSince the applicable Commonwealth Terms and Conditions and the Standard Contract Form are available \\nelectronically, it is important to note that any changes or electronic alterations by either the Department \\nor the Contractor to the official version of these forms, as jointly published by ANF, CTR and OSD, shall be \\nvoid.  Furthermore, Departments are advised to include language in their RFR informing bidders that, by \\nsubmitting a response, they are agreeing to execute these and other Commonwealth standard forms as is \\nand may not raise exceptions or make changes to these forms if awarded a contract. \\n \\nUnsuccessful Negotiations: If the Department is unable to negotiate the programmatic, fiscal or \\nadministrative terms of the contract with the initially selected bidder(s) in a reasonable period of time, \\nthen the Department may disqualify that bidder and begin negotiations with the next qualified bidder. A \\nDepartment may also choose to cancel the procurement and either begin again or pursue any other option \\npermitted under the regulation. \\n \\nPursuant to 801 CMR 21.07(2)(d), a selected bidder’s response may be disqualified if, according to the \\nPMT, the bidder \\n \\n1. Intentionally delays the timely execution of the applicable Commonwealth Terms and Conditions or the \\nStandard Contract Form or is unable to execute timely even for reasonable delays. \\n2. Conditions the execution of the applicable Commonwealth Terms and Conditions or the Standard \\nContract Form upon the procuring Department’s acceptance of additional material or amended contract \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 29 of 48 \\nterms and conditions, or specifies that the bidder’s response is “non-negotiable,” “all-or-nothing” or \\nthat there can be “no substitutions.” \\n3. Negotiates in bad faith. \\n4. Refuses to execute a Commonwealth Terms and Conditions or the Standard Contract Form. \\n5. Demands that the Department execute the bidder’s contract form instead of or in addition to the \\napplicable Commonwealth Terms and Conditions or the Standard Contract Form. \\n6. Is unable to reach final agreement on contractual terms with the Department within a reasonable time \\nas determined by the Department. \\n \\n\\uf03f For POS Only: Other Negotiation Considerations: Department staff who are responsible for negotiating \\nhuman and social service contracts also need to be familiar with and understand the limitations imposed \\non such contracts by statute (including G.L. c. 29, s. 29B; St. 1993, c. 110, s. 274, as amended), \\nregulation (including 808 CMR 1.00) and funding source (legislative language or federal grant language). \\nFor example, reimbursements for commodities and services that are not directly required for the specific \\nclient service are prohibited. \\n \\nDepartment negotiators should also carefully review 808 CMR 1.00, especially sections 1.03 on price and \\nreimbursement limitations and 1.05 on non-reimbursable costs. (See also the associated guidance entitled \\nGeneral Audit and Compliance Requirements available via a link at the end of this document.) While the \\nfailure of a Department to identify contract terms that do not conform to such provisions does not relieve \\nthe Contractor of its obligation to comply, it is obviously better for all if such problems can be avoided. \\n \\nContract Signed/Dated by Authorized Signatories \\n \\nContracts must have live signatures and dates by an authorized signatory of the Department and the \\nContractor.  The date is an inextricable part of a contract signature and cannot be pre-filled, pre-typed or \\nadded by anyone other than the signatory.  The signatory must execute the contract and indicate the date \\ntheir signature was made.  Signatories may not enter dates that are prior (retroactive) to the actual date \\nthe signature was made.  Department head or authorized signatory and authorized signatory of the \\nContractor must sign (wet signature) and date Contract or amendment prior to start of performance, or \\ncontemporaneously with the need for an amendment.  Minor changes or corrections made after execution \\nof a contract or amendment must be initialed by the authorized signatories of both parties, or the \\ndocuments must be re-executed to reflect the corrections.  \\n \\nElectronic signatures can not be used for contracts, amendments or underlying supporting \\ndocumentation requiring a signature.  Electronic signatures are limited to the MMARS \\ntransactions that support contracts and amendments.  This restriction does not apply to RFRs and \\nresponses to RFRS that are submitted electronically through Comm-PASS, provided that contracts, \\namendments and other documents requiring signatures (W-9s etc.) are submitted in hard copy with a wet \\nsignature. \\n \\nDepartment Head Authorized Signatories will be listed as part of a Department’s MMARS security roles.  \\nIndividuals who are assigned “Administrator” security Role with Department Head Signature Authorization \\nmay authorize any MMARS transaction on-line or on behalf of any other staff and may also authorize any \\nunderlying supporting documentation, including executing contracts.   \\n \\nPlease see section above Live Signatures and Dates Required on Contracts.  Please see Policy Chapter on \\n“Department Head Signature Authorization and Electronic Signatures for MMARS transactions” \\nand Policy Chapter on MMARS “Security” for additional information. \\n \\nContractor Authorized Signatory Listing (CASL)  \\n \\nA Contractor Authorized Signatory Listing (CASL) is required for any Contract executed by the \\nDepartment.  This policy applies to all state Departments within the Judiciary, Executive and Legislative \\nBranches.  A Contractor Authorized Signatory Listing (CASL) must be obtained for any contract \\nregardless of value. \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 30 of 48 \\nSubmitting a document to Final status in MMARS will be interpreted as the Department Head’s certification \\nthat the document and all underlying supporting documentation are supported by sufficient authorized \\nfunds and comply with Comptroller policies and procedures and other requirements of law (including \\nprocurement requirements, legislative requirements, etc.). \\n \\nThis certification includes the requirement outlined in this policy that the Department is \\nresponsible for verifying the authority of any contract signatory to sign a contract (both for the \\nDepartment and the Contractor) and the authenticity of the signature on a contract (the \\nsignature was actually made by the authorized signatory and not a designee).  Therefore, a \\nDepartment may not submit any contract related MMARS transaction to Final status unless the \\ncontract signatories have been validated in accordance with this policy. \\n \\nAt a minimum, a list of authorized signatories for a Contractor must be attached to the record copy of \\neach contract or contract amendment filed at the Department.  This CASL may be obtained once per \\nContractor (as part of either the procurement or contract execution process) and photocopied and \\nattached to each contract the Department has with that Contractor until the listing is updated. \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nThe CASL listing DOES NOT have to be attached to: \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAny photocopy of a contract submitted to CTR or OSD for PEND review and processing; or  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAny Commonwealth Terms and Conditions or Commonwealth Terms and Conditions for Health and \\nHuman Services, submitted to CTR for filing. \\n \\nReview of proof of Contractor signature authorization will be made during Quality Assurance and other \\npost-audit reviews.  Departments will be reviewed or audited based upon the policies identified in this \\nPolicy.  \\n \\nPlease see “Contracts – Contractor Authorized Signatory Listing Policy” for additional \\ninformation and Vendor/Customer File and W9s for requirements for Department verification of \\nany VCC or VCM.  \\n \\nDetailed Description of Performance  \\n \\nThe scope of contract performance must be detailed enough to identify the expected performance, the \\nappropriate classification of expenditure (object codes) and the proper state accounting system (MMARS) \\ntransaction type.  (Please see the Expenditure Classification Handbook for object codes and accompanying \\nauthorized transactions and other requirements).  For most contracts, the performance will be outlined in \\na procurement document and a Contractor’s response to the procurement.  For other contracts, these \\ndetails will be negotiated after the contract award as part of the contract scope of performance and \\nbudget.  Contracts which are executed for a multi-year period must reflect terms which are applicable for \\nthe full period of the executed contract.  \\n \\nRequired Approvals \\n \\nThe following approvals may be required for a contract.  Some approvals are required to be obtained prior \\nto the execution of a contract and may affect the contract effective start date.  The purchasing \\nDepartment is responsible for obtaining all necessary approvals for contract execution and for notifying \\nthe Contractor when all approvals are received and funding is available to begin performance. \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nDepartment Head Approval.  Department head or authorized signatory must sign (wet \\nsignature) and date Contracts, amendments or other obligations prior to the start of performance, \\nor contemporaneously with the need for an amendment, payment etc.  Electronic signatures can \\nnot yet be used for contracts, amendments or underlying supporting documentation. A Department \\nmust be authorized to enter into contracts (appropriation to support contract) in order to make \\npayments against contracts and the Department Head or designee must approve itemized \\nexpenditures. See G.L. c. 29, § 19.  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nSecretariat Signoff.  Secretariat signoff is required for consultant contracts (G.L. c. 29, § 29A); \\nhuman and social service contracts (G.L. c. 29, § 29B) prior to the effective start date of contract; \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 31 of 48 \\nCTR and OSD will not verify secretariat signoff as part of prior review, but will verify signoff as part \\nof quality assurance reviews.  There is no standard format for secretariat signoff.  The Department \\ncan obtain secretariat signoff of the RFR or the contract, provided the signoff is obtained prior to \\nthe effective start date of the contract and the format for obtaining the secretariat signoff is \\nreliable and verifiable.  Processing a contract MMARS transaction to Final status will act as a \\ncertification to the Comptroller that secretariat signoff has been obtained.  Compliance with this \\nrequirement shall be subject to audit.  Please see section on Secretariat Signature Authorization \\nabove.   \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAttorney General Approval Legal Services Contracts (all Departments).  All Commonwealth \\nDepartments are required to obtain prior written review by the Office of the Attorney General \\n(AGO) for any legal services performed for the Department under a contract.  The AGO review of \\nlegal services contracts is limited to determining that any attorney/firm hired by a Department is a \\nmember of the Massachusetts Bar (or out of state bar) in good standing, has no apparent conflicts \\nof interests, and if providing litigation services, will appear in court on behalf of the Commonwealth \\nonly after his/her appointment as a Special Assistant Attorney General (SAAG) by the AGO.  The \\nAttorney General Review Form for Attorneys Providing Legal Services form must be completed and \\nmailed (with required attachments) to the AGO for any new legal services contract, and for any \\nsignificant amendment to the scope of services under an existing contract, PRIOR to the start of \\nperformance or change in performance.  Please see: Attorney General Policy for Prior Review of \\nAttorneys.  The form must include: \\no \\nAn attached detailed Scope of Services outlining the specific legal services (H09 and N03 \\nobject codes) that will be performed by the attorney or firm.  AGO PRIOR to beginning any \\nservices.  \\no \\nA copy/printout of the Board of Bar Overseers record of good standing for each attorney \\nlisted who will be assigned to perform services, or who are identified as “key personnel” \\nunder the Contract.  Link to the following Internet site:  \\nhttp://db.state.ma.us/obcbbo/bboreg/lookup.asp.  Locate each attorney assigned to \\nperform contract services and print out the “Attorney Status Report” for each attorney.  \\nSimilar documentation of licensure and good standing must be provided for any out-of-state \\nattorney.  Departments must annually verify that any attorney(s) assigned to the contract \\nremains in good standing for the duration of the contract.  \\no \\nExecutive Departments must attach a Consultant Contractor Mandatory Submission Form \\ncompleted by the Contractor with all required attachments.  (Pursuant to G.L. c. 29, s. 29A \\nand G.L. c. 7A, s. 6); Non-Executive Departments must attach a statement of financial \\ninterest from the attorney(s) pursuant to G.L. c. 7A, s. 6 and may use the Consultant \\nContractor Mandatory Submission Form or other appropriate format.) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nOffice of the Chief Counsel to the Governor signoff of all legal services.  The Office of the \\nChief Counsel to the Governor requires signoff of all legal services contracts (H09, N03) prior to \\nprocuring the services or executing a contract (Level III –Executive only) (See G.L. c. 30, § 65 and \\n801 CMR 21.00).   \\n\\uf0a7 \\nOversight Department Secondary Review.  CTR, OSD and other oversight Department may \\nrequire secondary review for contracts exceeding the MMARS transaction processing delegation \\nthreshold.  MMARS transactions are targeted for workflow to the relevant oversight Department to \\ncomplete the review in order to process the document.  OSD reviews MMARS transactions for \\nCommodities and Services for non-statewide contracts which exceed a Department’s delegation \\nthreshold.  Please see OSD’s Procurement Information Center (PIC) for more detailed \\ninformation related to commodities and services secondary review.  CTR reviews services \\ncontracts, grants, subsidies, construction contracts which exceed a Department’s delegation \\nthreshold, and all ISAs.  OSD’s and CTR’s secondary review is not a legal review and signoff will not \\nbe interpreted to mean that the underlying document, supporting documentation and process are \\nlegal.  The Department Head makes this certification when the document is submitted to Final \\nstatus and sent to workflow.  Oversight Departments conduct quality assurance and administrative \\nreviews of the paperwork and document to ensure basic compliance state finance law and other \\napplicable requirements. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nPayroll Approval Relative to personnel.  Sometimes all or a portion of the payroll of a state \\nemployee may be funded from a contract (usually an InterDepartmental Service Agreement (ISA).  \\nThe Comptroller requires a certification from each spending authority on the bi-weekly payroll \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 32 of 48 \\nconfirming the hours worked by employees and that the payments are in compliance with state \\nfinance law.  This certification includes a certification required under G.L. c. 29, § 31 from each \\nspending authority that each employee receiving a salary under the warrant is being paid for \\n“duties performed directly for the employing agency and not for duties performed for another state \\nagency”.  Therefore, employee from one Department may not perform the duties of another \\nDepartment absent specific legislative authorization.  Departments need to ensure that contracts \\nand payroll are approved in accordance with these requirements.  Please see InterDepartmental \\nService Agreements (ISAs) for additional information on the use of ISAs to fund payroll costs for \\nstate employees.   \\n \\nContract Effective Start Date and Termination Date \\n \\nPursuant to 801 CMR 21.00, 815 CMR 2.00, 815 CMR 6.00, and this CTR policy, the contract effective \\nstart date for all contracts using the Commonwealth Terms and Conditions and Standard Contract Form, \\nor the InterDepartmental Service Agreement Form will be interpreted to be the latest date the contract is \\nsigned and otherwise approved by the parties, or a later date specified in the contract.  Notwithstanding \\nany verbal or written representations the legal effective start date of a contract shall be determined by the \\nlatest dates the contracts were executed: \\n\\uf0a7 \\nby an authorized signatory of the Contractor (verified through Contractor Authorized Signatory \\nListing which must be attached to the contract) and  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nby an authorized signatory of the Department (verified through checking Department Head \\nSignature Authorization/Security plan filed as part of the Department’s Internal controls),  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nthe date the contract received Secretariat or other approvals required by law or regulation, if \\napplicable, including:  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nSecretariat signoff required for consultant contracts (G.L. c. 29, § 29A); human and social service \\ncontracts (G.L. c. 29, § 29B) prior to the effective date of contract.  (CTR and OSD will not verify \\nsecretariat signoff as part of prior review, but will verify signoff as part of quality assurance \\nreviews.) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAGO approval for attorneys as Special Assistant Attorneys General (SAAGs) for attorneys \\nrepresenting Departments in court (litigation services) unless attorney already approved as SAAG.  \\nApplies to all Departments (Levels I-III) and must be obtained prior to start of performance. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nOffice of the Chief Counsel to the Governor signoff of all legal services contracts (H09, N03) prior \\nto submitting to Final status in MMARS (Level III –Executive only) (See G.L. c. 30, § 65). \\nAnd,  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nany LATER date for performance to begin listed in the contract.   \\n \\nA contract (including a grant, subsidy or ISA) will terminate on the date listed as the termination date in \\nthe contract unless the contract is properly amended prior to that date or unless terminated earlier in \\naccordance with the terms of the contract. \\n \\nPursuant to G.L. c. 29, § 26, § 27 and § 29, obligations may not be incurred unless there are sufficient \\nappropriated or non-appropriated funds available to support the obligations.  Therefore, contract \\nexecution which occurs prior to the beginning of the fiscal year in which funds are to be appropriated will \\nnot authorize obligations to be incurred prior to the appropriation of funds (Interim budget or GAA). \\n \\nEffective Start and Termination Dates in Contract Must Match Encumbrance and Payments \\n \\nPrior to submitting a MMARS contract encumbrance document to Final status the Department \\nAdministrator processing the document is responsible for ensuring that the dates, amounts and other key \\ninformation in MMARS match the information that appears on the contract documents including verifying \\nthe contract effective start date and termination dates based upon the signature and approval dates.  \\nSubmission of the document to Final status acts as the Department Head’s certification that MMARS \\nreflects the legal effective start date based upon the signature and approval dates appearing in the \\ncontract. \\n \\nThe effective start date and the contract termination date listed in the Contract must match the dates on \\nthe encumbrance and payment documents (transaction) in the state accounting system (MMARS).  The \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 33 of 48 \\nonly exception to this general rule involves certain statewide contracts or MSAs for leases or maintenance \\ncontracts which may have contracts that begin during the start and termination dates of the Statewide \\nContract or MSA but may have payment obligations which extend beyond the termination date of the \\nprocurement and underlying Statewide contract or MSA.  Departments will be audited based upon the \\naccuracy of MMARS entries in relation to supporting contract documentation. \\n \\nInterdepartmental Service Agreements (ISAs) require that ISA performance may not begin until the ISA is \\nexecuted AND funding is available for expenditure in the Seller Department’s Child account.  See \\nInterdepartmental Service Agreements (ISAs) and the Interdepartmental Service Agreement (ISA) \\nForm. \\n \\nChecking Debarment Status of Contractor  \\n \\nContractors signing the Standard Contract Form certify that neither the Contractor nor any of its \\nsubcontractors are currently debarred or suspended by the federal or state government under any law or \\nregulation including, Executive Order 147; G.L. c. 29, s. 29F G.L. c.30, § 39R, G.L. c.149, § 27C, G.L. \\nc.149, § 44C,   G.L. c.149, § 148B and G.L. c. 152, s. 25C.  \\n \\nAll departments must check the debarred vendor lists below before awarding or renewing a \\ncontract in order to ensure that they are not awarding a contract to a debarred vendor.  \\nNo Department shall knowingly accept a response or award a contract to any Contractor, or approve a \\nsubcontract to any party which is currently subject to any state or federal debarment order or \\ndetermination, including, but not limited to, M.G.L. c.29, § 29F, M.G.L. c.30, § 39R, M.G.L. c.149, § 27C, \\nM.G.L. c.149, § 44C,   M.G.L. c.149, § 148B and M.G.L. c.152, § 25C.  Pursuant to 801 CMR 21.06 (10), a \\n“Procuring Department shall disqualify any response that the Department determines to be unresponsive, \\nincluding, but not limited to: … (d) Responses submitted by a Bidder, or which identify a subcontractor, \\ncurrently subject to any State or federal debarment order or determination.” \\nThe following websites contain lists, which are updated periodically, of businesses, which have been \\ndebarred: \\n• \\nFederal Government’s Excluded Parties List System  \\n• \\nDivision of Capital Asset Management Debarred Contractor’s List  \\n• \\nBusinesses Issued Stop Work Orders by the Department of Industrial Accidents  \\n• \\nOffice of the Attorney General Debarment List  \\n• \\nContractors Suspended or Debarred by MassDOT \\nSee Vendor Debarment. If you have questions about debarment, you may contact OSD\\'s Legal Bureau \\nvia email.   \\n \\nThe Federal General Services Administration (GSA) has posted the Federal Government’s List of Parties \\nExcluded from Federal Procurement and Non-procurement Programs on the World Wide Web. OMB \\nCircular A-87 Attachment A and U.S. Executive Order 12459 state that a contract should not be made with \\nany party that has been debarred or suspended. Noncompliance could result in a reduction or termination \\nof federal funds to a state Department that provides federally-funded programs. The GSA prepared list \\nincludes contractors that are excluded from Federal procurement. Similarly, M.G L. c. 29, § 29F requires \\nthe Secretary of Administration to establish and maintain a consolidated list of contractors to whom public \\ncontracts shall not be awarded and from whom offers, bids, or proposals shall not be solicited.  The \\nstatute mandates that any Contractor debarred or suspended on these lists cannot participate in State \\ncontracts.  \\n \\nCurrently, ANF supports the use of the GSA list as the ANF listing required under the statute.  All \\nDepartments should consult the federal GSA list before moving forward with any procurement related \\ndecisions.   \\n\\uf0a7 \\nThe address of the GSA site is: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100000. \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 34 of 48 \\n\\uf0a7 \\n For ease of access you can also access the Federal General Services Administration (GSA) list from \\nthe Operational Services Division Home Page or the Massachusetts’ Procurement Access & \\nSolicitation System (Comm-PASS) Home Page.  OSD/Comm-PASS Home Page: \\nhttp://www.mass.gov/osd \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nOnce at the site, do the following: \\n\\uf0a7 \\nEnter your Name (you will be asked to accept the provisions of the \"Computer Matching and \\nPrivacy Act of 1988\" before you can access the data.)  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nSelect the \"Search Menu\" Option  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nSelect the \"Search by Name\" Option  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nEnter the Name of the Party You Wish to Search. \\n \\nIn addition, the Central Register published by the Secretary of the Commonwealth contains a list of \\ncontractors suspended or debarred by the Division of Capital Asset Management and a list of parties \\ndebarred by the Fair Labor and Business Practices Division of the Office of the Attorney General.  \\n \\nIn the event a Department seeks to debar a Contractor for severe circumstances, the Department must \\ncontact the Secretary for Administration and Finance who has the authority to debar vendors in \\naccordance with the notice and hearing provisions outlined in G.L. c. 29, § 29F.  Further guidance on \\nprocurement can be found in the OSD Procurement Information Center (PIC). \\n \\nContract Funding Requirements - Obligations May Not Exceed Appropriation  \\n \\nPursuant to G.L. c. 29 § 26, § 27 and § 29, Departments are required to expend funds only for the \\npurposes set forth by the Legislature and within the funding limits established through appropriation, \\nallotment and subsidiary.  Departments may not incur a liability for the Commonwealth in excess of their \\nappropriation or allotment.  This means that a Department cannot authorize performance to begin under a \\ncontract (including a grant, ISA, chargeback, lease, rental or TELP), request or accept commodities or \\nservices (including personnel) in excess of an existing appropriation and allotment, or sufficient non-\\nappropriated available funds. \\n \\nAvailable funding means funds that have been appropriated and allotted, or otherwise available which can \\nbe encumbered and expended (including federal funds that have been authorized and are available for \\ndraw down, or trust funds with sufficient cash).  Funding identified in a filed but not yet enacted \\nappropriation act, supplemental budget or other legislative act shall not qualify as available funding and \\nwill not be sufficient authorization for continued performance or new performance.  Authorization by \\nHouse and Senate Ways and Means Committees, the Governor’s Office, Executive Office for Administration \\nand Finance or any other oversight agency shall not be sufficient authorization for continued performance \\nor new performance since this authorization is not legislative authorization for expending appropriated \\nfunds Please also see “Commonwealth Bill Payment Policy” for additional requirements.. \\n \\nInsufficient Appropriations for Required Expenditures, Expiring Accounts \\n \\nAppropriations and allotments must be spent in accordance with prescribed subsidiary schedules.  G.L. c. \\n29, § 27;  G.L. c. 29, § 26.  Departments must do everything legally allowed to manage within their \\nappropriation.  Departments must immediately notify ANF and House and Senate Ways and Means \\nCommittees of the estimated amount of anticipated deficiency in any appropriation. G.L. c. 29, § 9E.  In \\naddition, to support the series of reliances and delegation, Departments must also notify CTR. \\n \\nIf funding is not available for encumbrance and expenditure, a Department may not authorize \\nperformance to begin or continue, and any performance must halt, personnel reassigned or suspended, or \\nother business adjustments made so that no obligations will be incurred in excess of current available \\nfunding. \\n \\nIf accounts are not reauthorized past the termination date (such as on June 30th for operating accounts, or \\nat the end of a capital bond authorization), or for federal grant awards that have not been made (even if \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 35 of 48 \\nrecurring), Departments may not continue to incur obligations or continue to accept services from \\nemployees or contractors in these accounts.  Contracts must be terminated or suspended, personnel \\nmust be terminated, or contracts and personnel transferred to another appropriate account \\nlegislatively authorized to fund these types of obligations and expenditures. \\n \\nPursuant to G.L. c. 149, § 148, employees must be paid for performance within 5 days of the close of the \\npay period in which they have performed services.  Therefore, it is a serious legal violation, subject to \\nsevere penalties, to request or allow any employee to work without available funding to pay for the \\nperformance within the required payment period.  Therefore, when budget cuts or shortfalls are \\nanticipated, Departments may not request or allow employees to work unless funding will be available to \\npay the employees for the work performed.  Layoff notices must be done with sufficient lead time (45 \\ndays or longer in some cases) to ensure that performance is suspended prior to funding run outs. \\n \\nExpenditures may not be made against other accounts to “front” funds during this time period and such \\nexpenditures may not be retroactively transferred (Expenditure Correction - EX) to these accounts should \\nthe accounts be re-authorized or a new account(s) established.  The Comptroller may not make journal \\nentry (expenditure correction) between accounts if the account ultimately to be charged had insufficient \\nfunds at the time the amount was expended from the other account, unless prior notice is sent to HOU \\nand SEN Ways and Means. (See G.L. c. 7A, § 3).  \\n \\n“The Comptroller shall refuse to permit a disbursement or incurring of an obligation if funds, or \\nallotments of funds, under an appropriation account or subsidiary account under an appropriation \\naccount, sufficient to cover such disbursement or obligation are not available and shall immediately \\ngive notice of such refusal to the Department, office, commission, or institution proposing the \\nexpenditure”  See G.L. c. 29, § 29. \\n \\nThis means that expenditures made to another current account because a supplemental budget has not \\nyet passed, or ISA funding has not been set up, cannot later be charged to the new accounts or \\nreauthorized accounts when the supplemental budget passes, without prior written notice to the House \\nand Senate Committees on Ways and Means (unless the supplemental budget account is authorized with \\nan effective date prior to the date of the expenditures) \\n \\nIf delays are anticipated for any source of funding (including delays in bond funds or the re-award of \\nfederal grant funds) the Chief Fiscal Officer has an obligation to immediately notify CTR of the anticipated \\ndelay, as well as their budget analysts at ANF (if applicable) to seek guidance.    \\n \\n Please also see “Commonwealth Bill Payment Policy” for additional requirements. \\n \\nObligation Authorization Limited by Fiscal Year - Interim Budgets and Accounts Payable. \\n \\nGAA appropriations shall be for ordinary maintenance for the fiscal year unless otherwise authorized.  \\nAppropriations are authorized for commodities, services and other obligations incurred, received and \\naccepted in the current fiscal year and may not be used to pay for future fiscal year obligations (advance \\npayments) nor for prior fiscal year obligations.  See G.L. c.29, § 12.  This means commodities and \\nservices to be paid for with current fiscal year appropriations must be received within the fiscal year (July \\n1-June 30) (see G.L. c. 4, § 7, Ninth). \\n \\nLawful obligations that do not exceed Department’s 1/12th allotment (made quarterly) may be made \\nbetween July 1 and passage of GAA if there is an interim budget.  No commodities or services may be \\naccepted for the new fiscal year and no funds may be expended without an Interim Budget or GAA.  See \\nG.L. c. 29, § 12A.  \\n \\nCTR and ANF will submit an Interim Budget request in the event that the GAA is not passed by the \\nLegislature and signed by the Governor by July 1st. This will provide funding for the continuation of \\nessential services across the Commonwealth. While no new programs or projects are supported as part of \\nthe interim budget, all routine business to carry out Department missions is included (i.e., payrolls, client \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 36 of 48 \\nbenefits, leases, commodities and services).  Once you are notified that the Interim Budget is signed, \\nDepartments should proceed with routine business, including paying bills in 30 days.  Departments are \\nresponsible to expend only funds from accounts that are in both the House and Senate Budgets. If there is \\na question about whether an account will be funded, the CFO should confer with ANF. \\n \\nThe accounts payable period to pay encumbrances for fiscal year ending on June 30th runs from July 1st \\nthrough August 31st.  The Fiscal Affairs Division (FAD) may extend the accounts payable period to pay \\nencumbrances until September 15th subject to special request from Department.  State finance law \\nrequires that remaining balances revert to the General Fund on or before September 15th.  G.L. c.29, § \\n13. \\n \\nPlease also see “Commonwealth Bill Payment Policy” for additional requirements. \\n \\nContract Compensation Must be Identified and Reserved \\n \\nDepartments are responsible for identifying funding availability (appropriation and allotments) prior to \\nincurring any obligation (including allowing personnel to work) or executing a contract.  Each contract \\nmust have a maximum obligation or specified rates for the full period of the contract.  The full value of the \\ncontract (maximum obligation) or the full value of “anticipated expenditures” must be reserved (pre-\\nencumbered or encumbered) for the full period of the contract in the MMARS state accounting system \\nupon execution of a contract and contemporaneously with the start of performance, to enable payments to \\nbe processed timely (within 30 days of the first invoice, or earlier if specified in the Contract or if prompt \\npayment vendor discounts are available), or to establish the accounts necessary to support an ISA.  \\n(Please see “Accounts Payable – Bill Paying Policy” for bill payment requirements.  Please see Policy  \\n“Contracts – Interdepartmental Service Agreements (ISAs)” for the funding requirements for ISAs.) \\n \\nHigher Education Departments may have contracts that are funded with appropriated state funds on \\nMMARS and non-appropriated trust funds that are outside MMARS.  If a contract is funded from both \\nMMARS and non-MMARS funds there must be supporting documentation (a detailed budget showing the \\namounts funded through MMARS and through the university) as a part of the contract.  The contract must \\nidentify the MMARS and non-MMARS related portion so that the total maximum obligation matches the \\ncontract.   \\n \\nContract Encumbrances Considered “Commodity-Based Encumbrances” \\n \\nUnder MMARS the term “commodity” applies to both commodities and services.  Commodities include but \\nare not limited to any articles of trade, items, products, supplies, information technology resources, \\nautomated data processing and telecommunication hardware, software and systems.  Services include but \\nare no limited to furnishing of time, labor, effort, specialized skills by a Contractor including operational, \\nprofessional, maintenance, consultant, maintenance and repair, non-professional and human and social \\nservices.   \\n \\nThe contract related MMARS transactions are considered “Commodity-based” documents and are the only \\nMMARS transactions with a “commodity” line.  These documents require a commodity code.   \\nNon-Commodity Based Encumbrances  \\n \\nNon-commodity based encumbrances reserves funds for postage, subscriptions and memberships, \\nadvertising expenses, fees, fines, licenses, and permits, confidential investigation expenses, donations, \\nexhibits/displays, electricity, sewage disposal, water, natural gas, incidental purchases and other \\nexpenditures that do not require a procurement and contract.   \\n \\nDepartments should refer to the Expenditure Classification Handbook for details on which \\nencumbrances are available for selected object codes.  For additional guidance related to MMARS \\ntransactions see Job Aids for Procurement/Contracts and Policy Chapters under “Accounts Payable” for \\npayments. \\n \\nContract Filing \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 37 of 48 \\n \\nAll Departments are required to file complete original or certified copies of contracts as directed by the \\nComptroller prior to payment.  G.L. c. 7A, § 5.  Pursuant to 815 CMR 10.00 each Department shall be the \\nrecord keeper of the original copy (“record copy”) of all contracts and supporting documentation.  The \\nrecord copy shall be filed at the Department.  Copies of a contract may have to be submitted to CTR or \\nOSD for prior review and processing if the total value of the contract exceeds the MMARS transaction \\nprocessing (transaction) delegation limit for the Department.  \\n \\nThe Comptroller requires that all contracts are encumbered and filed promptly upon execution to ensure \\ntimely payment for all performance in accordance with state finance law and the Commonwealth Bill \\nPaying Policy.  Please see “Accounts Payable – Commonwealth Bill Paying Policy”. \\n \\nProper IRS/Contractor Registration (Vendor/Customer File) \\n \\nA Contractor or other payee must be registered with the proper IRS form (Form W-9-Massachusetts \\nSubstitute W-9 Form,  or W-8 – Foreign Payees) in the state accounting system.  Please see Policy \\nChapter “Accounts Payable – Vendor Management and W-9s”.   \\n \\nSubmitting a document to Final status in MMARS will be interpreted as the Department Head’s certification \\nthat the document and all underlying supporting documentation are supported by sufficient authorized \\nfunds and comply with Comptroller policies and procedures and other requirements of law (including \\nprocurement requirements, legislative requirements, etc.). \\n \\nThis certification includes the requirement outlined in this policy that the Department is \\nresponsible for verifying the authority of any contract signatory to sign a contract (both for the \\nDepartment and the Contractor) and the authenticity of the signature on a contract (the \\nsignature was actually made by the authorized signatory and not a designee).  Therefore, a \\nDepartment may not submit any contract related MMARS transaction to Final status unless the \\ncontract signatories have been validated in accordance with this policy. \\n \\nThe Accounts Payable Bureau of CTR is considered the official Commonwealth Clearinghouse for all \\nmatters related to Federal Income Tax reporting to the IRS and State Income Tax reporting to the \\nDepartment of Revenue (DOR).  This involves the filing of tax reporting forms as an employer (W-2, \\n1099s etc.) and upkeep of the Internal Revenue Services’ and DOR’s rules and regulations for compliance.  \\nThe Accounts Payable Bureau provides technical guidance to Departments regarding their responsibilities \\npertaining to issuing and filing tax reporting information which is not captured at the detail level in MMARS \\nand/or statewide automated payroll systems (HR/CMS and e*mpac).  Please see Vendor/Customer \\nFile and W9s Policy for Department requirements to verify authority and validate all vendor \\ninformation.  \\n \\nVendorWeb \\n \\nDepartments are encouraged to instruct Vendors to use VendorWeb at \\nhttps://massfinance.state.ma.us/VendorWeb/vendor.asp  to track contract payments (with the exception \\nof interdepartmental payments).  Vendors can see their scheduled payments and payment history by \\nlogging on VendorWeb.  On-line you find the tentative scheduled payment date or the actual payment \\ndate, payment number, vendor invoice number, contract number, line amount, any associated text \\ninformation and the Department making the payment.   \\n \\nThe VendorWeb application was created to help the Commonwealth’s vendors get their payment \\nremittance information free and easily.  Vendors access VendorWeb with their Commonwealth Vendor \\nCode.  Vendors can view or download information for payments made and payments scheduled in old and \\nnew MMARS to be paid.  Payment information can be generated using date ranges and can be sorted by a \\nselected Department or by payment from all Departments.   \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 38 of 48 \\nDepartments within the Magnet firewall can also access the CTR Intranet for state employees through the \\nmain CTR website (www.mass.gov/osc)  under “Vendor lookup” to verify payments without having to log \\nin to MMARS.   \\n \\nPayments Require Current Appropriation, CTR Certification and Approved Warrant \\n \\nNo payments shall be made without current appropriation, Department Head approval, Comptroller \\ncertification and approved Governor’s warrant. G.L. c. 29, § 18.  MMARS has been established with \\ninternal controls which prohibit payments from being made unless there are sufficient funds appropriated, \\nallotted and encumbered to support the payments. See G.L. c. 29, § 20.   \\n \\nIn addition, the Comptroller will not certify payment until a Department Head or designee approves the \\nexpenditures.  Submitting a document to Final status in MMARS will be interpreted as the Department \\nHead’s certification that the document and all underlying supporting documentation are supported by \\nsufficient authorized funds and comply with Comptroller policies and procedures and other requirements of \\nlaw (including procurement requirements, legislative requirements, etc.).   \\n \\nOnce Comptroller certification occurs systemically, the successful processing of payment is entered on the \\nwarrant and processed in accordance with the warrant approval process. \\n \\nBill Paying Policy – Payments  \\n \\nThe Comptroller is required to establish a vendor payment schedule.  G.L. c. 7A, § 5.  Departments are \\nrequired to make payments in accordance with the terms of any contract and the Commonwealth’s Bill \\nPayment policy.  For details on payments see Non-Tax Revenue Policies, including the \\nCommonwealth Bill Paying Policy, which includes guidance on standard payment policies, intercept, \\nprompt pay discounts, late penalty interest, retainage, prohibition of pre-payments, payment for result-\\nbased performance, payment for obligations incurred, payment limited to current fiscal year obligations, \\nrecurring and ready payments, contingent fee payments, overpayments and contract back outs.  \\n \\nPrompt Payment Discounts (PPD)  \\n \\nDepartments are required to have Contractors complete the PPD section of the Standard \\nContract Form or identify a legitimate hardship.   \\n \\nDepartments may NOT negotiate accelerated payments in less than the standard \\npayment cycle of 45 days and Payees are NOT entitled to accelerated payments UNLESS \\na prompt payment discount (PPD) is provided to support the Commonwealth’s loss of \\ninvestment earnings for this earlier payment, or unless a payment is legally mandated \\nto be made in less than 45 days (e.g., construction contracts, Ready Payments under \\nG.L. c. 29, s. 23A). \\n \\n• \\nRequiring a PPD to be identified as part of a procurement or contract does not mean that an automatic \\ndiscount will be taken or that the Contractor is required to make a price reduction.  The discount on \\nthe total payment will apply ONLY if the Contractor requests “accelerated” payments in LESS than the \\nstandard payment cycle (currently 45 days).   \\n• \\nContractors that do not want to offer a PPD agree that all payments will be made in the normal course \\nof business using the standard payment cycle and may not later request an accelerated payment \\nunless a PPD is offered.   \\nExceptions for PPD \\n \\nAll Commonwealth contract payments will be processed in the standard payment cycle of 45 days from the \\ndate of an invoice receipt unless there is another legally mandated payment cycle such as: \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 39 of 48 \\n• \\nG.L. c. 30, § 39G – payments on horizontal construction and maintenance projects (roads, bridges, \\netc.), within 30 days.  \\n• \\nG.L. c. 30, § 39K – payments on vertical construction and maintenance projects (buildings), within 30 \\ndays for periodic payments.  \\n• \\nG.L. c. 79, § 37  - payments under certain conditions on Eminent Domain within 30 days.  \\n• \\nCertain credit card payments that require payment within 21-25 calendar days. \\n• \\nReady Payments for human and social services under G.L. c. 29, s. 23A.  \\n• \\nOther statutory or regulatory payment cycles of less than 45 days. \\n \\nFederal and state grant awards are not exempted from the PPD policy will be paid under the standard \\npayment cycle.  Delay in getting contracts executed, financial hardship, or demands for prompt payments \\nare not sufficient legal reasons for automatically accelerating ALL payments under a Contract.  The first \\ngrant or contract installment or payment may be accelerated for the first invoice or initial grant \\ninstallment, but subsequent periodic installments or invoice payments must be scheduled to support the \\nPayee cash flow needs and the standard 45 day EFT payment cycle in accordance with the \\nCommonwealth’s Bill Payment Policy unless a PPD is provided or an earlier payment date is legally \\nmandated. \\n \\nNOTE:  For any contract with an annual single payment, the standard payment cycle must be used unless \\na PPD is provided and this payment may NOT be scheduled to be accelerated in less than the standard \\npayment cycle.   \\n \\nAny accelerated payment that does not provide for a PPD must have a legal justification in Contract file for \\naudit purposes justifying the requirement for an accelerated payment and why the standard payment \\ncycle could not be followed for all payments.  .   \\n \\nEven if a Department has not included the Prompt Payment Discount (PPD) as part of \\nthe RFR process, or for contracts when a procurement is not required, the Department \\nshould require a Contractor to complete Prompt Payment Discounts during the \\ncontract execution, renewal or amendment process to ensure that Prompt Payment \\nDiscounts are available to both the Contractor and the Department to the maximum \\nextent possible. \\n \\nSee also the “Prompt Payment Discounts Policy” for additional details on including this cost savings \\nmechanism in contracts.  \\n \\nAssignment of Payments \\n \\nPursuant to G.L. c. 106, § 9-318, a Contractor may freely assign payments under a contract to a third \\nparty.  The third party receiving payment is called an assignee.  An assignee is not considered a \\n“Contractor” and may not have a separate vendor code established for an assigned payment.  All contract \\npayments are due and owing to the Contractor and the assignee has no legal right to make any claims to \\nthe Department under the contract.  The assignment of payments merely re-directs payments that have \\nbeen lawfully earned and paid to the Contractor to another address.  All reports of payments and tax \\nreporting are recorded for the Contractor.   \\n \\nThe Department has an obligation to verify that the request for the assignment of payments is legitimate \\nand requested directly by the vendor and not the third party.  Absent a court order (verified by the Office \\nof the Attorney General), a Department has no obligation to honor any demands for assignments \\nmade by a third party, even if the third party produces an assignment agreement signed by the \\nvendor.  The Department must still obtain confirmation from the Contractor that the assignment is \\nallowable and a W-9 with the new remittance address is submitted. \\n \\nA Department MAY NOT establish a new vendor code or obtain a W-9 form or a Commonwealth \\nTerms and Conditions from the assignee.  \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 40 of 48 \\n1. The Department must receive documentation from an authorized signatory of the Contractor that \\nthe Contractor agrees to assign payments to a third party assigned under a particular contract(s). \\n \\n2. The Department then submits to the Accounts Payable Bureau a Vendor/Customer Modification \\nForm (VCM) for the Contractor with a FORM W-9 (MASSACHUSETTS SUBSTITUTE W-9 FORM) to \\nadd an additional “payment address” (remittance address) with  “Attn.” or “c/o” or “payable to:” \\nand the assignee’s name and payment address. \\n \\n3. The Contractor’s Legal Name, TIN and Legal Address MAY NOT be changed.  The \\nDepartment must also submit EFT (Electronic Fund Transfer) documentation (required for all \\npayees unless a one-time payment or a hardship accepting EFT) as applicable to enable payments \\nto the assignee electronically. \\n \\n4. Payments are then made using the vendor code with this additional payment address.  A \\nDepartment MAY NOT change the Contractor’s legal address to the address of the third party since \\nthe legal address is necessary for tax reporting purposes and the third party assignee should not \\nget the Contractor’s tax forms.   \\n \\nThe assignment of payments will be made on a contract-by-contract, and Department-by-Department \\nbasis and will not be made on a statewide basis for all payments due a Contractor (unless approved by \\nboth OSD and CTR for a Statewide Contract).  In the event a payment is inadvertently issued to the \\nContractor, the Department will have no obligation to “chase” the payment.  The Contractor will be legally \\nobligated to forward that payment to the assignee.  The assignee has no rights against the Department \\nunder any assignment agreement or under any contract. \\n \\nPlease see “Commonwealth Bill Payment Policy” for additional requirements and  \\nVendor/Customer File and W9s for requirements for Department verification of any VCC or \\nVCM.   \\n \\nComm-PASS Posting Requirements (if the Request for Response was Posted on Comm-PASS \\n \\nIn addition to executing the Standard Contract Form, certain Comm-PASS posting requirements \\nassociated with the contract are mandatory for RFRs posted on Comm-PASS. Specifically, Departments \\nmust \"post the contract\" on Comm-PASS. The Comm-PASS system, through its contract \"wizard,\" guides \\nthe Department through the entries of contract award date, additional team members, if any, contract \\ndocuments (the upload of these documents, other than the Standard Contract Form), vendors, vendor \\ndocuments (such as price lists), vendor SOMBWA certification and EPP participation and contract updates. \\n \\nDepartments are required to either post the contract or update the solicitation within 60 days of the close \\ndate of the solicitation even if a contract has not yet been awarded. Please see the associated guidance \\nentitled Comm-PASS Policies in the Procurement Information Center (PIC). \\n \\nNote: Comm-PASS does not automatically transform a Solicitation into a Contract. To complete the \\nsolicitation portion of the procurement process on Comm-PASS, Department users are required to perform \\nan Update, which requires the selection of a status: Closed-Pending Evaluation, Closed-Pending Award, \\nClosed-Contract Awarded, or Closed-Cancelled.  \\n \\nOnce the Solicitation reaches a Closed-Contract Awarded status, the Department user must use the \\nContract functionality to create a separate Contract record. \\n \\nContract Management \\n \\nThe purpose of contract management is to ensure that Departments are satisfied with Contractor \\nperformance and that the Contractor is in full compliance with all of the terms and conditions of the \\ncontract.  Additionally, contract management supports the Contractor to ensure that Departments make \\npayments in accordance with payment terms, are familiar with procurement processes of the \\nCommonwealth and the automated systems that support the procurement and payment process, i.e., \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 41 of 48 \\nMMARS, Ready Payment, Recurring Payment, EFT and Comm-PASS.  Contract management is customer \\nservice.  Its primary role is to assist and/or resolve any and all issues, concerns and problems that may \\narise from customers and contractors as it relates to contracts administered by the Commonwealth. \\n \\nContract Managers \\nA contract manager is assigned responsibility for the oversight and management of the activity within a \\ncontract, including compliance with state finance law and applicable laws, regulations, policies and \\nprocedures.  Part of effective internal controls, fiscal responsibility and effective and efficient expenditure \\nof Commonwealth funds is dependent upon careful oversight and management of a contract by the \\nContract manager.  Contract managers who are listed on the Standard Contract Form are considered \\nauthorized representatives who can manage the contract on behalf of the Department.  Among other \\ntasks, a contract manager may: \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nProvide document processing and technical assistance to contractors and customers; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nConduct market research and analysis to determine the strengths and/or weaknesses of the \\nmarketplace which will assist in determining the effectiveness of the contract and whether or not \\nthe terms, conditions and costs are competitive in the current environment; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nGenerate usage reports to determine dollar volume and what services or products are being utilized \\nand measure this information against projections; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nMeasure Contractor performance against established performance criteria to ensure compliance \\nwith the terms and conditions set forth in the contract; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nConfer with customers, contractors and potential bidders in order to exchange information and \\nkeep up to date with current needs and current products being offered by the industry; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nCoordinate and attend exhibitions and conferences to become familiar with new commodities and \\nservices for Department use; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nInitiate contract negotiations and determine whether contracts should be renewed; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nConfer with legal staff to determine corrective action, when necessary, to bring a Contractor back \\ninto compliance with a contract; and  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nConduct user surveys to determine the effectiveness of existing contracts and the potential for new \\ncontracts. \\n \\nDepartments are encouraged to communicate regularly with Contract Managers, especially when new \\npolicies are distributed to the Department’s key state finance law officers, and ensure that staff are \\nappropriately trained and have access to the tools necessary to ensure state finance law compliance.   \\n \\nMonitoring And Evaluating Contractor Performance And Compliance \\nThe Commonwealth has a responsibility to conduct monitoring and evaluation of the commodities and \\nservices it purchases. These activities can assist in identifying and reducing fiscal and programmatic risk \\nas early as possible, thus protecting both public funds and clients being served. In addition, federal \\nmonitoring requirements must be observed if federal funds are used to purchase services. \\n \\nContract managers and Department Affirmative Market Program (AMP) Coordinators are responsible for \\nmonitoring Contractor performance and other issues that arise during the life of the contract. In \\ndeveloping monitoring and evaluation procedures, the Commonwealth, through its Departments or PMTs, \\nshould strive for methods which rely on, among other things, national or industry standards and which are \\ncoordinated, cost efficient and appropriate to the level of risk to the Commonwealth in the purchase of the \\ncommodities or services. \\n \\nThe following are some tips that may provide assistance during contract monitoring: \\nContract compliance: \\n• \\nAssign a contract manager with the authority, resources, time, skill and adequate training to do the \\nmonitoring. \\n• \\nPeriodically review the language in the contract to verify the Contractor is complying with terms of the \\ncontract. \\n• \\nEnsure compliance with any state or federal laws or regulations which have been specified in the \\ncontract. The contract manager may ask for documentation from the Contractor at any time to verify \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 42 of 48 \\nthis compliance. Examples include tax compliance, current worker’s compensation contributions, \\ncurrent unemployment insurance documentation or compliance with the Affirmative Market Program \\nPlan. \\n• \\nIf the RFR required bidders to include resumes of key individuals they planned to use to fulfill the \\nrequirements of the contract, Departments should periodically check to be sure these same key \\nindividuals are, in fact, performing those contract requirements. \\n• \\nManage Affirmative Market Program (AMP) Plans by ensuring compliance of M/WBE commitments; \\nreview reports regarding usage of subcontractors M/WBEs for the purposes of Departmental credit \\ntoward fiscal year benchmarks. \\n \\nContract performance: \\n \\n• \\nDocument the date, time and name of the Contractor representative who has contacted the \\nDepartment regarding contract performance, questions, etc. Document any responses given. \\n• \\nReview and require progress reports to verify if the Contractor is meeting targeted performance \\ndeadlines or ask for documentation to support that performance is on schedule. \\n• \\nConduct announced or unannounced site visits and record reviews. \\n• \\nSolicit customer feedback on Contractor performance, outcomes and value. \\n• \\nDocument the date, time and name of the Contractor representative who has contacted the \\nDepartment regarding contract disputes. Document how the dispute was resolved. If the dispute is not \\nimmediately resolved, or may involve contract interpretation, immediately contact the Department \\nlegal staff for guidance (if the Department has no legal staff, then contact the secretariat). If the \\ndispute involves the potential for or a threat of litigation, the Department legal staff should \\nimmediately consult with the Attorney General’s Office Trial Division for guidance. \\n \\nContract deliverables and payment: \\n \\n• \\nReview all deliverables submitted or shipped to the Department to ensure they are in compliance with \\nthe contract specifications. Departments should be careful to instruct individuals signing for packages \\nthat it is necessary to, at a minimum, verify the type and number of items or packages received prior \\nto signing for any shipping order. Some contractors use shipping companies rather than delivering \\npackages themselves. It is important to verify at least the number of packages received. Final review \\nand acceptance or rejection of the items delivered may be made later. \\n• \\nCompare invoices and charges to contract terms and conditions. \\n• \\nPromptly review invoices upon receipt and return any rejected invoice with an explanation for its \\nrejection. Depending upon Department established internal control procedures, the contract manager \\nor the responsible accounts payable person generally does this review. A Department may hold or \\nreject an invoice, upon notice to a Contractor, until a Contractor has completed required performance \\nor corrected poor performance. It may also hold or reject an invoice in the event of a breach of \\ncontract or default. \\n• \\nWithhold final payment or invoice until final performance is completed. \\n• \\nRetain documentation supporting delivery and/or payment issues with the Contractor. \\n \\nContract termination or renewals: \\n \\n• \\nAt least six months prior to the termination date of the contract (longer for complex procurements), \\ndetermine any remaining available options to renew or begin a new competitive procurement process. \\n• \\nIf exercising an option to renew, forward the amendment documentation for completion and execution \\nat least 30 days prior to termination date of contract. \\n• \\nIf the contract is being terminated, notify the Contractor of the termination date. Include any \\nperformance which has not been completed and a list of Department data, personal data, files, \\nequipment or other Department property which must be returned to the Department at the \\ntermination of the contract. \\n \\nGeneral: \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 43 of 48 \\n• \\nReview the procurement file to verify that all documentation is available and that its location, if \\nelectronic or in another file, is identified. \\n• \\nRequire formal or informal audits of a Contractor’s records as specified in the Request for Response. \\n \\nThe contract manager may want to develop a checklist that can be attached to the procurement file, or an \\nelectronic file with an automatic date flag to remind the contract manager of deadlines and other \\nreminders during the contract period. Contract managers should regularly evaluate the quality and overall \\nsuccess of the Contractor in meeting the requirements of the contract by asking: \\n \\n• \\nConsidering all factors, did the procurement generate the best value for the customer? \\n• \\nWere customers or recipients of the service satisfied with the performance of the Contractor? \\n• \\nWhat are suggestions for improving service delivery and how can they be incorporated into the \\nexisting contract or future procurements? \\n \\nIf a Contractor’s poor performance is serious enough to suggest contract termination, debarment or \\ndisqualification actions, documentation regarding customer satisfaction should be used to support the \\ncontract manager’s decision. \\n \\nGuidelines for Monitoring and Enforcing Compliance of the Affirmative Market Program (AMP) \\nPlan for Large Procurements \\n \\nThe Executive Office for Administration and Finance (ANF) and the Operational Services Division (OSD) \\njointly issue the Affirmative Market Program (AMP) portion of the RFR for use by agencies. It is the \\nexpectation that all parties act in good faith in the execution of this AMP policy. The prime Contractor \\nshould immediately communicate any difficulties relative to compliance with AMP requirements to the \\ncontract manager, PMT or AMP Coordinator. Once the contract manager, PMT or AMP Coordinator has had \\nan opportunity to make an assessment of the circumstances and issues involved, appropriate measures \\nwill be taken to address any concerns or issues of non-compliance for all parties involved. A Contractor \\nmay be considered out of compliance with the AMP Plan under certain conditions, including, but not limited \\nto, the following: \\n \\n• \\nThe timeline of the benchmark has not been met. \\n• \\nThe AMP form(s), verification(s) of certification or verification of expenditures with M/WBEs are \\nmaterially incomplete by the due date or have not been submitted in accordance with the contract \\nrequirements. \\n• \\nThere has been a change in or substitution to identified M/WBEs without prior notification to and \\napproval by the contract manager or AMP Coordinator. \\n \\nIf the Contractor or subcontractor is not in compliance with the terms agreed to in the AMP Plan, the \\ncontract manager or AMP Coordinator should work closely with the Contractor to resolve any outstanding \\nissues. This may involve informal discussions with the Contractor about the specific AMP related problem \\nand include a meeting with the Contractor to discuss the issue. The Contractor shall provide information \\nas is necessary in the judgment of the contract manager, PMT or AMP Coordinator to ascertain its \\ncompliance with the terms agreed to in the AMP Plan. \\n \\nIf no resolution occurs and the problem continues, more formal steps should be taken, including the \\nfollowing: \\n \\n• \\nSend written notice to the Contractor from the contract manager, PMT or AMP Coordinator describing \\nthe problem, proposed solution and response time required. Send a copy of the notice to the PTL and \\nOSD, if applicable. \\n• \\nConduct follow-up meetings with the Contractor.  \\n• \\nInitiate formal corrective action plans with written notice from the procuring agency or OSD, as \\nappropriate, if no resolution has occurred at this point. \\n• \\nReview invoices upon receipt for the purpose of determining whether to reject said invoices. Any \\nrejected invoices will be returned with a written explanation for its rejection. This may occur at any \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 44 of 48 \\ntime during the period of non-compliance with the AMP Plan (depending upon agency-established \\ninternal control procedures, the contract manager, PMT or AMP Coordinator and in conjunction with the \\nresponsible accounts payable person). Upon notice to the Contractor, an agency may suspend a \\ncontract until a Contractor has resolved the AMP non-compliance. An agency may also impose a \\npenalty fee, upon notice, if it has statutory authority and has specified the potential for a penalty in \\nthe RFR. \\n• \\nRefer the matter to the agency’s legal counsel if a Contractor’s poor performance in meeting their AMP \\nPlan benchmarks is serious enough to suggest contract termination, debarment or disqualification \\nactions. \\n \\nThe contract manager, PMT or AMP Coordinator should maintain sufficient documentation of all written or \\nverbal communication to support the actions taken to resolve any non-compliance issues with the AMP \\nPlan. Please see the associated guidance entitled Affirmative Market Program, available via a link at the \\nend of this document for more information. \\n \\nResolution of Customer Complaints \\n \\nA key part of customer satisfaction is the resolution of customer complaints. Once received, the \\ncomplaints should be responded to promptly and a resolution process begun. One suggested approach for \\nresolving complaints might include the following: \\n \\n• \\nAcknowledge the complaint and get details from the end-user/complainant. \\n• \\nCritically review the Request for Response/contract for adequacy, specificity and clarity. \\n• \\nInformally contact the Contractor about the specific complaint, RFR or contract language, and propose \\nor invite a solution, such as: \\n \\n1. Ad hoc fix. \\n2. Contract change, if needed. \\n3. Need for additional complaint details. \\n4. Joint meeting with Contractor and customer, if desired. \\n \\nPlace all documentation related to the resolution in the procurement file. \\n \\nUsually, this informal process will resolve most complaints. However, the contract manager may wish to \\nfollow-up with the customer in question, as well as other customers who have not complained, to ensure \\nthe problem is successfully resolved and is not indicative of a pattern of poor performance. If no resolution \\noccurs and the problem continues, more formal steps should begin as follows: \\n \\n• \\nProvide written notice from the Department to the Contractor, indicating the problem, the solution and \\nthe response time required; send a copy to the PTL and OSD, if applicable. \\n• \\nConduct a follow-up meeting with Contractor. \\n• \\nInitiate formal corrective action plans (with written notice from the procuring Department or OSD, as \\nappropriate) if there is no resolution. \\n \\n \\nAmendments \\n \\nEffective contract management requires a Department to monitor Contractor performance and \\ncompliance.  Although day to day contract correspondence and communications may be made \\nelectronically (email or fax)  any changes in performance, funding, obligations, or changes in the terms of \\na contract (including grants, subsidies, ISAs, etc.) must be memorialized contemporaneously with the \\nneed for the change in a formal contract amendment.  Electronic signatures or contracts are not yet \\nauthorized for contracts or amendments.  Therefore, Departments may negotiate an amendment \\nelectronically, but must finalize the amendment in the same manner as the contract with written (wet) \\nsignatures by authorized signatories of the Department and Contractor.  \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 45 of 48 \\nPlease see “Amendments, Suspensions and Termination Policy” for additional detailed information \\nregarding amendments, changes in performance, changes in dates of service, time extensions, exercising \\noptions to renew, material changes in Contractor identity, changes in Contractor Tax Identification \\nNumber (TIN), Contractor legal name or address changes, contract suspensions and terminations.  \\n \\nNote: Regardless of Comm-PASS Subscriber status, every active vendor listed on a Contract in Comm-\\nPASS receives email notifications when a Contract is amended. An amendment on Comm-PASS does not \\nconstitute a legal change, but is merely a change to the record by the Contract manager. This means that \\nDepartment contract managers can use the Comm-PASS amend capabilities to communicate with all \\nvendors. For example, an amendment \"reason\" might read, “Fill out and return Affirmative Market \\nProgram (AMP) Plan, if applicable.” The form can be attached to the Forms and Terms page for easy \\naccess. \\n \\nContract Disputes, Litigation or Mediation \\n \\nIn most cases, contract disputes or conflicts arise due to miscommunication, misunderstandings, or lack of \\naccurate or timely information.  Enhanced communication and careful monitoring of contract performance \\ncan usually resolve most disputes.  Departments are encouraged to develop internal methods for resolving \\ndisputes.  If a Department is unsuccessful at resolving a dispute the Department may consider other \\nmethods such as litigation or mediation.   \\n \\nFiscal Staff should be instructed that they have an obligation to notify their General Counsel \\nimmediately whenever a potential contract dispute arises that may trigger the need for \\nintervention, alternative dispute resolution, or that may potentially result in litigation.   The \\nDepartment General Counsel is the key contact with the AGO and should contact the Attorney \\nGeneral’s Trial Division (617) 727-2200; for further assistance with approvals for mediation \\nor to refer potential contract dispute litigation. \\n \\nPlease see Policy “Amendments, Suspensions and Termination Policy” for additional information and \\nrecommendations related to amendments, suspensions and terminations.  \\n \\nViolation of State Finance Law \\n \\nAny Department Head or designee who knowingly violates state finance, or authorizes or directs \\nanother officer or employee to violate any provision of G.L. c. 29, or any rule or regulation \\npromulgated there under, or any other provision of law relating to the incurring of liability or expenditure \\nof public funds law shall be punished by fine of $1,000 or imprisonment for one year, or both.  See G.L. c. \\n29, § 66. \\n \\nConflict of Interest \\n \\nThe Conflict of Interest Law, G.L. c. 268A, is one of several laws that govern dealings with public officials \\nand employees. Contractors certify compliance with G.L. c. 268A each time they execute a Commonwealth \\nStandard Contract Form. In order to ensure the integrity that is critical to the public procurement process, \\nall Departments must make certain that employees and participants involved in the procurement process \\nare free from all conflicts of interest. A summary of the requirements is included below. Additional \\ninformation can be obtained from Departmental legal counsel or the State Ethics Commission guidelines \\nand Disclosures.  \\n \\n• Bribery - A Contractor may not offer or give anything to a public official in exchange for that \\nofficial agreeing to perform or not perform an official act. \\n \\n• Registered Executive and Legislative Agents - If a Contractor’s responsibilities involve \\ninteraction with the state legislature, the Executive branch, or independent authorities, the \\nContractor should contact the Secretary of the Commonwealth’s office regarding the requirement \\nto register as an executive or legislative agent. Registered agents may not give anything to a \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 46 of 48 \\npublic official or policy-making public employee, or to an immediate family member of a public \\nofficial or policy-making public employee. \\n \\n• Gifts and Gratuities - Even if a Contractor is not a registered agent, the Contractor may not give \\na public official or any public employee anything “of substantial value” for or because of the \\nofficial’s duties. State employees may, under appropriate circumstances, attend Contractor \\nsponsored seminars or trade shows where the state will benefit by receiving information about \\nproducts, new techniques, business trends, and other matters of concern to state purchasing. \\n \\n• Hiring Public Employees - Except in rare instances, a Contractor may not pay or otherwise \\ncompensate a public employee in connection with any matter that is “of direct and substantial \\ninterest” to their public employer. \\n \\n• Hiring Former Public Employees - Former public employees and their business partners may \\nnever accept pay or other forms of compensation in connection with matters in which they \\nparticipated as public employees. Also, even if they did not personally participate in the matters, \\nthere is a one year period before former public officials may personally appear before government \\nDepartments in connection with matters that had been under their official responsibility. \\n \\nContractor Code of Conduct and Business Ethics. In the Standard Contract Form a Contractor \\ncertifies that performance under a Contract, in addition to meeting the terms of the Contract, will be made \\nusing ethical business standards and good stewardship of taxpayer and other public funding and resources \\nto prevent fraud, waste and abuse.  The Contractor certifies that a Code of Conduct and Business Ethics \\nwill be available for review upon request within 60 days of the Effective Date of this Contract which will be \\nprovided to all employees and subcontractors involved in contract performance.   \\n \\nRecords Management – Procurement and Contract Files   \\n \\nIn accordance with 815 CMR 10.00, the Department is the keeper of the official record copy of contracts \\nand invoices and all back up supporting documentation.  MMARS is the official record of the encumbrance \\nand payment documents entered into the system and will supersede any paper copies of the same \\ninformation.  The contract/procurement/payment file must contain or refer to the location of all \\ndocumentation related to the particular contract and payments.  A Department is responsible for retaining \\nand archiving contract records, (including invoices, back up supporting documentation and invoice \\nverification) in accordance with the Statewide Disposal Schedules issued by the Secretary of State Records \\nConservation Board.  Please see Policy “Records Management”. \\n \\nPublic Records and Access.  In the Standard Contract Form a Contractor shall provide full access to \\nrecords related to performance and compliance to the Department and officials listed under Executive \\nOrder 195 and G.L. c. 11, s.12 seven (7) years beginning on the first day after the final payment under \\nthis Contract or such longer period necessary for the resolution of any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit \\nor other inquiry involving this Contract. Access to view Contractor records related to any breach or \\nallegation of fraud, waste and/or abuse may not be denied and Contractor can not claim confidentiality or \\ntrade secret protections solely for viewing but not retaining documents. Routine Contract performance \\ncompliance reports or documents related to any alleged breach or allegation of non-compliance, fraud, \\nwaste, abuse or collusion may be provided electronically and shall be provided at Contractor’s own \\nexpense. Reasonable costs for copies of non-routine Contract related records shall not exceed the rates for \\npublic records under 950 C.M.R. 32.00.   \\n \\nProcurement/Contract File Contents \\n \\nDuring the life of the contract, additional information, which may be maintained electronically unless the \\noriginal or a written signature is required, will be added to the procurement file. This is in addition to \\ndocuments regarding the procurement process and contract execution. The file should be an accurate \\nrepresentation of all the facts, circumstances and details of both the procurement and ongoing contract \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 47 of 48 \\nperformance/management. Please see the policy document entitled How to Conduct a Procurement for \\ninformation about creating a procurement file. \\n \\nNote: Comm-PASS supports file versioning and file segregation, which can reduce the amount of paper \\nfiles. As long as an electronic version exists and does not contain information which is exempt from public \\nrecord law, e.g., bank routing codes, Department users can upload files to either the contract’s Forms and \\nTerms page or the Vendor(s) detail page. If a file must be replaced or updated, the previous versions will \\nbe retained within the record’s Amendment History located on the Other Information page. \\n \\nContract management related documents may include: \\n• \\nCopies of all invoices or where located (electronic or manual as required internally), including rejected \\ninvoices and notices to Contractor with reasons for rejection. \\n• \\nAn accounting of all payments made or where located (electronic or manual). \\n• \\nCopies of any written notices or other faxes, memoranda or correspondence with the Contractor. \\n• \\nDocumentation related to Contractor legal name change or material change in identity, including the \\nChange in Contractor Identity Form, if applicable. \\n• \\nContract amendments and related transactions, if applicable. \\n• \\nPurchase Order for Commodities and/or Services, if applicable. \\n• \\nDocumentation of contract monitoring and evaluation activities, such as performance reports, \\nsatisfaction surveys, site visit or audit documents, etc.  \\n• \\nAffirmative Market Program (AMP) Plans and vendor SOMWBA certification letters, if applicable. \\n• \\nInformation related to any contract disputes, including resolution. \\n• \\nDocumentation identifying any default, breach or unsatisfactory performance (notice should identify \\nlanguage in the contract detailing performance requirements and how the Contractor is failing to \\ncomply). \\n• \\nAny other information or documentation about the Contractor and contract performance that the \\ncontract manager deems relevant. \\n• \\nDocumentation related to negotiations pertaining to options to renew. \\n \\nPayroll Documentation \\nThe following list includes some examples of the types of documentation to be retained for payroll  and \\nhuman resource (HR) purposes.  Departments are required to keep all human resource (HR) and payroll \\nrelated documentation confidential and in a secured location accessible only to personnel required to enter \\nHR or payroll related transactions and adjustments. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nTime and attendance records signed by employee and supervisor, including hours worked and \\nleave taken; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nPosting to cumulative records; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nSigned contracts describing scope of services and rate to be paid to contract employees; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nProper allocation or distribution of employees’ time and cost to applicable Department; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nHiring letters or appointment documentation; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nPayroll certifications; and approvals where necessary; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nW-4 Forms and other documentation related to tax deductions; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nVoluntary and Involuntary payroll deduction or garnishment forms, including direct deposit, \\ndeferred compensation programs, Dependent Care Assistance forms, Insurance forms and \\nchanges, reimbursement requests; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nback up documentation related to payroll activities, changes or adjustments; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nEmployment claims, grievances, law suites and resolution documentation; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nPerformance reviews; and \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAny other documentation related to employment. \\nInternal Controls \\nThe Comptroller publishes Internal Control guidelines in consultation with the State Auditor’s Office.  All \\nDepartments are required to file an Internal Control Plan and review and update this plan to ensure fiscal \\nresponsibility and accountability. See G.L. c. 7A, § 9A.

The Office of the Comptroller has provided the \\nExpenditure Classification Handbook and this Policy Chapter to identify expenditures and related \\nrequirements. \\n \\nPolicy \\nComptroller Implementation of State Accounting System and Internal Controls \\n \\nThe Comptroller has broad authority to prescribe accounting rules and instructions for all state \\nDepartments and the appropriate use of the state accounting system.  Pursuant to G.L. c. 7A, § 7, G.L. c. \\n7A, § 8,  G.L. c. 7A, § 9 and G.L. c. 29, § 31 the Comptroller is required to implement a state accounting \\nsystem (including a centralized payroll system) and issue instructions for the accounting practices to be \\nused by all Departments for supplies, materials, assets, liabilities, equity, debt, encumbrances, \\nexpenditures, revenues, expenses and obligations of all Commonwealth funds and accounts, including \\npayroll, unless specifically exempted by general or special law.  The Comptroller has full authority to \\nprescribe, regulate and make changes in the method of keeping and rendering accounts and is authorized \\nto direct state Departments to implement changes in their systems to meet these statewide standards. \\n \\nOSD Statutory Authority And Oversight Of Procurement of Commodities and Services \\n \\nThe statutory authority vested in the State Purchasing Agent and OSD to oversee the procurement of \\ncommodities and services by Commonwealth entities is found in G.L. c. 7, s. 22, G.L. c. 30, s. 51 and G.L. \\nc. 30, s. 52. These statutes form the basis of OSD’s issuance of its procurement regulation, 801 CMR \\n21.00, which provides all Commonwealth Departments with uniform rules and standards governing the \\nprocurement of commodities or services, or both, including human and social services for clients. While \\nthese statutes specifically exempt the legislative branch and military division from their applicability, they \\nalso do not apply to all or part of the procurements of the following Commonwealth entities: \\n \\n• \\nThe judicial branch pursuant to Article 30 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of the \\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, which sets forth the separation of powers principle in the \\nMassachusetts Constitution. There is also case law, which supports the separation of powers of the \\nthree branches of state government but specifically states that it does not preclude participation on a \\nvoluntary basis. \\n \\n• \\nCities and towns and still-existing county entities of the Commonwealth, which must follow G.L. c. \\n30B, although they may purchase off of OSD statewide contracts per G.L. c. 7, s. 22A and G.L. c. 30B, \\ns. 1(c). OSD has no oversight authority over G.L. c. 30B or these entities. Although not required to do \\nso, cities and towns frequently purchase from statewide contracts because it saves them the time of \\nconducting their own procurement under G.L. c. 30B and the prices available from statewide contracts \\nare often more competitive due to the Commonwealth’s purchasing power. \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 3 of 48 \\n \\n• \\nThe University of Massachusetts, State Colleges and Community Colleges and the Higher Education \\nConsortium, which have statutory authority to conduct certain procurements pursuant to G.L. c. 75, s. \\n13, G.L. c. 73, s. 15, G.L. c. 15A, s. 24 and G.L. c. 15A, s. 24A. However, where these statutes are \\nsilent, these entities fall under OSD’s statutes and authority. \\n \\nIn addition, OSD has the authority, pursuant to St. 1993, c. 110, s. 274, as amended in St. 1993, c. 151, \\ns. 113; St. 1993, c. 296, s. 3; and St. 1993, c. 495, s. 99 and G.L. c. 29, s. 29B to oversee the \\nprocurement of human and social services by Commonwealth Human and Social Services Departments.  \\n \\nThese statutes form the basis for issuance of OSD’s regulation, codified as 808 CMR 1.00, which governs \\ncontract compliance, financial reporting and auditing requirements applicable to all procurements of \\nHuman and social services and to G.L. c.71B approved private schools subject to the authority of OSD. \\nRegulation 808 CMR 1.00 also describes the methods used by OSD in authorizing prices for approved \\nprivate school special education programs. For more information on OSD\\'s legal and regulatory authority, \\nplease contact OSD\\'s Legal Bureau at OSDLegal@osd.state.ma.us. \\n \\nQuality Assurance \\n \\nThe Comptroller has been granted full access to the books and papers of all Departments unless \\nspecifically exempted by general or special law.  The Comptroller has the authority to access all \\nDepartments records related to accounting transactions, and may conduct quality assurance reviews to \\nensure Department compliance with state finance law and Comptroller accounting instructions.  CTR works \\ncooperatively with OSD to ensure compliance with procurement and contract requirements.  Please see \\nPolicy Chapter “Contracts – Quality Assurance” and OSD’s Procurement Information Center (PIC).    \\n \\nMMARS is the Official Record of Fiscal Activities \\n \\nThe uniform system of accounting is known as the Massachusetts Management and Accounting System \\n(MMARS).  MMARS is a computerized electronic accounting system that has been established as the official \\nrecord of the Commonwealth’s accounting activities.  The Comptroller has established a series of fiscal \\ncontrols in the system to manage financial risks, reduce incorrect and incomplete entries and to prevent \\nthe payment of expenditures which exceed available funding.   \\n \\nWhat appears in the MMARS system will be considered the “official record” or “record copy” of fiscal \\nactivities and will supersede paper or other formats of the same information.  Departments must \\nremember that MMARS is an accounting system, used to accurately record and report on fiscal activities. \\n  \\n \\nFiscal Activity Based Upon a Series of Reliances \\n \\n \\n \\nIn order to support the Comptroller’s statutory responsibilities, state government fiscal transactions are \\nmanaged in MMARS through a series of reliances: \\n \\nThe Governor’s Council approves the warrant relying upon the “certification” by the Comptroller.  (G.L. c. \\n29, § 18) \\nThe Comptroller certifies expenditures on a warrant relying upon the “certification” of the Department \\nHead or designee evidenced by an electronic signature approval of a transaction in MMARS. (G.L. c. 7A, s. \\n3, G.L. c. 29, § 61; G.L. c. 29, § 20) \\nIt is imperative that everything entered into MMARS is verified as \\naccurate and complete before a document is submitted to Final status. \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 4 of 48 \\nThe Department Head certifies expenditures and other obligations in MMARS by relying on the Chief Fiscal \\nOfficer and other authorized Department Head signatories to manage the day-to day business of the \\nDepartment and approve expenditures on behalf of the Department Head; \\nThe Chief Fiscal Officer and other Department Head authorized signatories who approve purchases and \\nexpenditures, rely on staff to make purchases and confirm receipt, delivery and acceptance of \\ncommodities and services (including payroll) in accordance with prescribed laws, regulations, policies and \\nprocedures. \\n \\nSince the Comptroller cannot personally review and certify all payments from all state Departments, the \\nComptroller has set up the state accounting system (MMARS) with a series of checks and balances to \\nbalance fiscal risks with administrative and business efficiencies.  The Comptroller relies on Department \\nHeads to ensure that all payments and other documents sent to the Comptroller for certification through \\nMMARS have been approved by the Department Head as being legal, appropriate and properly submitted \\nin accordance with applicable law, policies and procedures. \\n \\nAlthough MMARS is an effective management tool, Departments can not rely solely on the MMARS system \\nto manage fiscal responsibility and decisions.  MMARS will not always prevent mistakes or incorrect \\nentries.  Some documents will pass all the system tests (edits) and be processed to Final status even \\nthough the expenditure, underlying procedures, procurement process, or contract documentation is legally \\ndeficient.  Therefore, just because Department staff are capable of processing a document to Final status \\nin MMARS will not be interpreted to mean that the document, or underlying documentation are \\nautomatically legal, appropriate or in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, policies or procedures.  \\nCompliance responsibility remains at all times with the Department staff who process documents to Final \\nstatus.  Since MMARS will track the staff who approves documents, quality assurance reviews will identify \\nnot only the documents that will be reviewed, but also the security identification of the individual(s) who \\nentered and approved the documents.   \\n \\nIn order to support the series of reliances, the Comptroller establishes requirements for the management \\nof Department Head Signature Authorization, Internal Control Plan Updates and Electronic Signatures for \\nMMARS transactions.  These policies and any applicable procedures shall apply to all Departments unless \\nspecifically exempted.  A Department’s use of MMARS requires at a minimum, agreement to comply with \\nComptroller laws, regulations, policies and procedures, even if other general or special laws exempt the \\nDepartment from compliance with Executive Branch requirements.   \\n \\nFiling of Department Head Signature Authorization (DHSA) as part of Internal Controls \\n \\nPursuant to G.L. c. 7A, s. 3, G.L. c. 29, § 61 and G.L. c. 29, § 31 prior to certifying any expenditure for \\npayment on a warrant the Comptroller requires that legislative leadership, judicial branch administrators, \\nelected officials, secretariats and Department Heads certify in an affidavit that articles have been \\nfurnished, services rendered (including payroll) or obligations incurred, as certified.   \\n \\nA Department Head is responsible for all activities conducted by the Department.  A Department must be \\nauthorized to enter into contracts in order to make payments against contracts and the Department Head \\nor designee must approve itemized expenditures. See G.L. c. 29, § 19.  \\n \\nIn order to obtain MMARS Security, all Department Heads (including new Department Heads) are required \\nto accept these responsibilities and conditions. \\nSee:  Department Head MMARS Security Certification Form \\n \\nSince a Department Head cannot personally review and certify all business transactions, the Department \\nHead is responsible for setting up the Department’s business operations with a series of checks and \\nbalances (known as internal controls) to balance fiscal risks with administrative and business efficiencies.  \\nA Department Head relies on the delegation of signature authorization to authorized signatories within the \\nDepartment who conduct the day-to-day business of the Department. \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 5 of 48 \\nA Department Head delegates signature authority to staff who will be responsible for conducting business \\non behalf of the Department Head in accordance with applicable law, regulations, policies and procedures.  \\nDelegation of Department Head signature authorization (DHSA) is an efficient administrative tool that \\nallows a Department Head to designate key staff who can incur obligations, make expenditures and \\nconduct the day to day Department activities on behalf of the Department Head. \\nIn order to support the use of electronic signatures each Department agrees that it will conduct all fiscal \\nbusiness in accordance with state finance law, including but not limited to G.L. c. 7A and G.L. c. 29, and \\nlaws, regulations, policies and procedures of the Office of the Comptroller. \\n \\nIf a Department is within the Legislative or Judicial Branch or is a non-Executive Department or institution, \\nagreeing to comply with state finance laws, including Comptroller laws, regulations, policies and \\nprocedures will not by implication extend compliance to Executive Orders or other Executive Branch \\ndirectives that this Department would not normally be subject to, unless the ability to use certain MMARS \\ntransactions, system functionality or benefits (such as transaction delegation or incidental purchases) \\ninvolves compliance with certain minimum requirements (such as the use of standard Commonwealth \\nboilerplate contracts, or compliance with minimum procedures).  If a Department chooses to take \\nadvantage of these benefits, the Department will comply with the minimum requirements identified by \\nCTR for these benefits, unless otherwise provided. \\n \\nAll staff with Department Head signature authorization to sign or approve documents, obligations or \\nexpenditures will be assigned to MMARS Administrator security roles.  Staff processing documents with \\nthese roles will not be required to obtain a signature or any additional authorization prior to processing a \\ndocument to Final status.  MMARS transactions processed with “Administrator” roles without Department \\nHead Signature Authorization will require sign off by an authorized signatory prior to making the \\ndocument final.  Such delegation shall not relieve the Department Head from any obligations or \\nresponsibilities under applicable general and special laws, regulations, policies and procedures. \\n \\nSince Administrator roles have the security to incur obligations and make payments, the Security Officer is \\nresponsible for ensuring that any Administrator roles are approved by the Department Head.  Changes to \\nAdministrator roles must be approved promptly by the Department Head and filed as part of the \\nDepartment’s Internal Controls and will also be communicated without delay to the Comptroller’s Security \\nOfficer.   \\n \\nAny MMARS transaction submitted to Final status and any underlying supporting documentation shall \\noperate as the Department Head’s certification that the documents are accurate and complete and that \\nthe expenditure or other obligation is supported by sufficient legislatively authorized funds and is made in \\naccordance with this Department’s legislative mandates and funding authority; and complies with all \\napplicable laws, regulations, policies and procedures.  Please see Policy Chapter “Department Head \\nSignature Authorization and Electronic Signatures for MMARS transactions” and Policy Chapters \\non MMARS “Security” for additional information. \\n \\nDirect Authorization for Department Head and Secretariat Signature Authorization (DHSA) – No \\nSub-delegation \\n \\nEach Department Head must directly authorize individuals to be their designee for approval of fiscal \\ndocuments or other legal obligations on their behalf.  There can be no sub-delegation by designees.  \\nAn individual granted signature authorization may not in turn sub-delegate Department Head \\nSignatory Authority to other individuals.  Each individual exercising signature authorization must be \\ndirectly authorized by the Department Head.  \\n \\n \\nAppointment of New Department Head \\n \\nWhen a new Department Head is appointed several duties the new Department Head must complete \\ninclude: \\n1. executing a Department Head Certification Form accepting electronic signature, record keeping and \\ncompliance with Comptroller laws, regulations, policies and procedures related to MMARS; \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 6 of 48 \\n2. the designation or ratification of Key State Finance Law Compliance Officers who will be responsible \\nfor assisting the Department Head with state finance law compliance; \\n3. the verified Assignment or ratification of individuals with MMARS Security Administrator roles, \\nincluding Administrator roles with Department Head signature authorization in each of MMARS \\nfunctional areas.  MMARS security roles will remain in place during any transition period when a \\nnew Department Head is appointed, but must be assigned or ratified within 30 days after a \\nDepartment Head assumes Department Head responsibilities. \\n \\nSecretariat Signature Authorization \\n \\nDirect delegation also applies to secretariat signatories.  Cabinet Secretaries must directly authorize \\nindividuals within their own Department, or in other Departments within the secretariat, to be their \\ndesignee to approve legal obligations, fiscal documents or other legal documents on the Secretary’s \\nbehalf.  Secretariat signoff is limited to circumstances requiring secretariat signoff.  For example, a \\nCabinet Secretary who wishes to enable Departments within the Secretariat to signoff on consultant \\nservice contracts in the “HH” and “NN” object classes and “U05” object code pursuant to G.L. c. 29, \\nSection 29A, and Human and Social Service contracts in the “MM” object class pursuant to G.L. c. 29, \\nSection 29B, must directly designate those individuals who will have this signature authorization at each \\nDepartment.  \\n \\nHowever, secretariat signoff provided to a Department within the secretariat will NOT authorize \\nthe Department designee to sign off on a secretariat contract, invoice, payroll or other \\nobligation.  A Department designee with secretariat authorization can only provide secretariat signoff for \\nits own Department obligations, not obligations of the secretariat as a Department.   \\n \\nSecretariat signoff is not captured as part of MMARS transaction approvals and therefore, there is no \\nMMARS security role which reflects secretariat signoff delegation, and no cross-Department security.  \\nSecretariats and Departments that have secretariat signoff delegation will be required to record this \\ndelegation as part of its internal controls.  For contracts requiring secretariat signoff, the approval must be \\nobtained prior to the effective start date of contract.  CTR and OSD will not verify secretariat signoff as \\npart of prior review (if applicable) but will verify signoff as part of quality assurance reviews.  There is no \\nstandard format for secretariat signoff.  The Department can obtain secretariat signoff of the RFR or the \\ncontract, provided the signoff is obtained prior to the effective start date of the contract and the format for \\nobtaining the secretariat signoff is reliable and verifiable.  Processing a contract MMARS transaction to \\nFinal status will act as a certification to the Comptroller that secretariat signoff has been obtained.  \\nCompliance with this requirement shall be subject to audit.   \\n \\nDepartment Head and Secretariat Signature Authorization Delegation Must Support Department \\nBusiness Needs \\n \\nSince Department Head and Secretariat authorized signatories may not sub-delegate their authorization to \\nother individuals, Department Head and Secretariat Signature Authorization should be structured to \\nensure that there are sufficient staff authorized to approve contracts, transactions, payroll and other \\ncritical business needs during staff vacations, maternity leave, sick leave or other leave or unavailability. \\n \\nFor example, a Payroll Officer who is authorized to approve payroll, or a Chief Fiscal Officer who is \\nauthorized to approve contracts, may not in turn sub-delegate Department Head signature authorization \\nresponsibility to other individuals during their absence or unavailability.  Department Head Signature \\nAuthorization should support Department business needs so that these officers have back up staff for \\nnecessary approvals.  Each Department should establish internals controls that identify how signature \\nauthorization will be implemented during these absences. \\n \\nLive Signatures And Dates Required On Contracts And Other Legal Obligations \\n \\nElectronic signatures are authorized only for the MMARS electronic accounting transactions \\nwhich support a Department’s business and legal obligations. \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 7 of 48 \\nTherefore, electronic signatures are authorized only to encumber funds, authorize payments or other fiscal \\ntransactions necessary to support contracts (grants, InterDepartmental Service Agreements (ISAs), \\nleases, subsidies, etc.) payments and other legislatively authorized activities. \\n \\nUnless otherwise authorized by the Comptroller, the record copy of all contracts, payrolls and other legal \\nobligations and related supporting documentation must be maintained by the Department in paper and \\nmust contain \"live\" signatures and dates.  The record copy of a contract or other legal obligation includes \\nthe following: \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAn original or duplicate original contract or document signed by the Department Head (or \\nauthorized signatory) and an authorized signatory of the Contractor. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nA copy of the original contract or document bearing the words “Certified True Copy” or “True Attest \\nCopy” and bearing the signature and date of the individual who is certifying or attesting that they \\nhave seen the original and have compared the copy with the original document and certify that the \\ncopy is a true copy of the original contract or document. \\n \\nLive signatures and dates are entered in pen by the Department Head or authorized signatory, and a \\nContractor or other party (if applicable).  The date of a signature is an inseparable part of the signature, \\nwhich documents the actual date of a signatory’s authorization.  Date stamps, typed or any other method \\nof pre-filled dates do not comply with this requirement. \\n \\nWhen CTR, OSD or other oversight Department performs a secondary review in order for a document to \\nbe completed to Final status in MMARS, a Department should submit photocopies (not originals) of the \\ndocuments and supporting documentation to the oversight Department.  Any original documents and \\ntransactions (including duplicate originals if not clearly marked duplicate original) submitted for processing \\nwill be returned to the Department.  Contracts, payments and other documents must reference applicable \\nelectronic accounting transactions (by document reference or identification number).  Photocopies \\nreviewed by CTR, OSD or other oversight Department will not be considered record copies and will be \\ndisposed of after use. \\n \\nThe only exception to these instructions will apply when the Comptroller or another oversight Department \\nis responsible for contracting or making payments on behalf of a Department, such as for Statewide \\nContracts, Settlements or Judgments, Tort Claims, Prior Year Deficiencies, or when the original of a \\ndocument is required to be filed at the oversight Department (such as MA substitute Form W-9s for \\nVendor or Customer registration, the Commonwealth Terms and Conditions, or the Commonwealth Terms \\nand Conditions for Human and Social Services filed at the Office of the Comptroller).  Departments will be \\nresponsible for submitting the original or a certified copy of the original contract or other document.  A \\ncertified or attested copy is a copy that has been reviewed and compared with the original documentation, \\nand is certified by the reviewer as a true copy of the original documentation.  The Comptroller or other \\noversight Department will be responsible for retaining and archiving the record copy of these documents \\nin accordance with the requirements of the Records Conservation Board and 815 CMR 10:00. \\n \\nDepartments will be responsible for maintaining and archiving the record copies of contracts and other \\nlegal obligations in accordance with records retention requirements of the Records Conservation Board and \\n815 CMR 10:00.  MMARS financial records will be maintained by the Comptroller with the assistance of the \\nInformation Technology Division in accordance with records retention requirements of the Records \\nConservation Board, the Information Technology Division and G.L. c. 110F. \\n \\nElectronic Signatures in MMARS \\n \\nElectronic signatures are limited to MMARS transactions and certain Comm-PASS documents.  Electronic \\nsignatures can not yet be used for contracts, amendments or Tax Identification Form including, \\nbut not limited to the Commonwealth Standard Contract Form, Standard Contract Amendment \\nForm or the Commonwealth Terms and Conditions.  However, OSD does allow, for Comm-PASS \\nsubscribers that are submitting a bid electronically, the electronic submission and signature of other forms \\nas long as final contract execution includes wet ink signatures on the Commonwealth Standard Contract, \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 8 of 48 \\nStandard Contract Amendment, Commonwealth Terms and Conditions, Authorized Signatory Listing and \\nMA substitute W-9 Forms. \\n \\nThis restriction does not apply to RFRs and responses to RFRS that are submitted electronically through \\nComm-PASS, provided that contracts, amendments and other documents requiring signatures (W-9s etc.) \\nare submitted in hard copy with a wet signature.  Therefore, Departments may negotiate a contract, an \\namendment or communicate electronically, but any contract or amendment must be finalized with written \\n(wet) signatures by authorized signatories of the Department and Contractor. \\n \\nUnder G.L. c. 110G, the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (added by St. 2003 c. 133) an \"electronic \\nsignature\" is defined as “an electronic sound, symbol, or process attached to or logically associated with a \\nrecord and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record.”  An electronic signature \\nwill be treated as if the authorized individual executed a written signature and date. \\n \\nIn accordance with G.L. c. 110G, the Comptroller is authorized to specify additional requirements for the \\nretention of electronic records subject to the Comptroller’s jurisdiction.  Since all MMARS activity is subject \\nto the Comptroller’s authority, the Comptroller establishes the minimum necessary requirements for the \\nuse of electronic signatures for MMARS activity in addition to any requirements of the Information \\nTechnology Division and the Records Conservation Board in accordance with G.L. c. 110G. \\n \\nElectronic Signature and Department Head Authorization of MMARS transactions  \\n \\nWith the implementation of the MMARS accounting system the Office of the Comptroller is aligning \\nElectronic Security with Department Head Signature Authorization (DHSA) begun in fiscal year 2005 to \\ntake advantage of electronic signatures for MMARS processing.  Every MMARS action must be \\nconfirmed/authorized by the Department Head or an authorized signatory.  Department head \\nauthorization can be accomplished in one of two ways: \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAdministrator Security with DHSA.  If the employee (Administrator - system processor) who \\nsubmits a document to Final status is a Department Head authorized signatory, the data in the \\nMMARS system will be sufficient documentation.  What appears in MMARS will be the record copy \\nof the document.   \\no \\nRecording Doc Id on all supporting documentation.  Since there is no paper copy \\nrequired for the MMARS transaction the Department will be required to include the MMARS \\ntransaction Identification number (Doc ID) on all supporting documentation to “match” the \\nsupporting documentation with the electronic record of the MMARS transaction which will \\nreside on MMARS.  Recording the Doc Id on all supporting documentation can be \\naccomplished by entry of the MMARS Doc Id on the first page of the supporting \\ndocumentation, or by entering the Doc Id on a MMARS transaction Authorization/Records \\nManagement Form which will act as the cover sheet to the supporting documentation for \\nrecords management purposes.   \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAdministrator Security without DHSA.  If the employee (Administrator - system processor) who \\nwill be submitting a document to Final status is not a Department Head authorized signatory, the \\nAdministrator must obtain a live (“wet”) signature from an authorized signatory approving the \\ndocument PRIOR to submitting the document to Final status in MMARS. \\no \\nReview of document and supporting documentation.  Since a Department Head is \\nrequired to authorize the official record of a MMARS transaction, which is what actually \\nappears in the MMARS system, Departments must ensure that whoever authorizes the \\ndocument has reviewed the document and related supporting documentation prior to \\nauthorization. \\no \\nWritten authorization. The written authorization may appear on a screen-print of the \\ndocument as entered and validated, but prior to final submission, or on a MMARS \\ntransaction Authorization/Records Management Form prescribed by CTR to capture \\nthe prior authorization for documents. \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 9 of 48 \\no \\nFiling of authorization with supporting documentation.  Authorization documentation \\nmust be kept on file at the Department along with the record copy of other supporting \\ndocumentation related to the MMARS transaction.  See Records Management below. \\n \\nWhat does electronic signature of a MMARS transaction mean? \\n \\nWhen a Department electronically submits a document to Final status in MMARS, the Department Head is \\ncertifying to the Comptroller that the individual, on behalf of the Department Head, understands that their \\nUAID (universal access identification) is being recorded for any entries made in the MMARS system and \\nthat that individual certifies under the pains and penalties of perjury that: \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nit is their intent to attach an electronic signature approval and date to the MMARS transaction, and \\nthat \\n\\uf0a7 \\nthey are either an authorized signatory of the Department Head who is authorized to approve the \\nMMARS transaction as part of the Department Internal Control Plan, OR \\n\\uf0a7 \\nthat the document they are processing and any supporting documentation have been approved by \\nan authorized signatory of the Department Head, secretariat and any other required prior approval \\n(including secretariat signoff if required) and a copy of these approvals are available at the \\nDepartment referencing the MMARS transaction number, and that \\n\\uf0a7 \\nany expenditure or other obligation is supported by sufficient available legislatively authorized \\nfunds and is in accordance with the Department’s enabling legislation and funding authority; and \\nthat \\n\\uf0a7 \\nthe MMARS transaction and any underlying supporting documentation are accurate and complete \\nand comply with all applicable general and special laws, regulations and policies including public \\nrecord intention and disposal requirements. \\n \\nThe fact that the MMARS system “allows” a document to process to Final status does not mean that the \\ndocument is automatically legal, in compliance with legislative or funding authority, or properly authorized \\nby a Department Head.  Therefore, staff must be trained that merely finding a systemic way to process a \\ndocument to Final status is insufficient, and that they will be held responsible and accountable for all \\nactivity under their UAID.  Individuals unsure of proper processing or required approvals have an \\nobligation to obtain guidance and approvals from their Chief Fiscal Officer prior to processing a document \\nto Final status. \\n \\nIndividuals who are granted electronic security access to submit MMARS transactions to Final status are \\ncapable of incurring legal obligations and making expenditures of Department funds that will be binding \\nupon the Department.  Since documents submitted to Final status will be considered electronically \\napproved by the Department Head, a Department will be responsible for all actions made by any individual \\nprovided with electronic approval security and may not later claim that an individual was not authorized to \\napprove an expenditure, obligation, transfer or payment. \\n \\nTherefore, a CFO and Security Officer should not grant electronic security Administrator access to allow \\nsubmission of MMARS transactions to Final status unless the Department can maintain sufficient internal \\ncontrols, oversight and quality assurance (post audit) reviews to ensure that individuals exercise such \\nelectronic security authorization in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, policies and procedures. \\n \\nSince approval security in MMARS acts as the Department Head’s approval and certification, Department \\nHeads should ensure that electronic approval security in MMARS is granted only to individuals who have \\nbeen delegated Department Head Signature Authorization (DHSA).  In larger Departments, the number of \\nindividuals granted (DHSA) by the Department Head may not be able to personally process all of the fiscal \\ndocuments necessary to support the fiscal actions they approve.  In addition, a Department Head may not \\nwant to grant Department Head signature authorization to the number of individuals necessary to process \\nthese fiscal transactions.  Therefore, the CFO and Security officer will be responsible for authorizing \\nelectronic security to enable efficient Department business provided that no MMARS transaction, under \\nany circumstances is submitted to Final status without first being approved by an authorized \\nsignatory of the Department Head. \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 10 of 48 \\nIt is a serious breach in internal controls and MMARS fiscal policies for any document to be submitted to \\nFinal status without first being approved by an authorized signatory of the Department Head.  Compliance \\nwith these policies will be subject to Quality Assurance reviews by the Office of the Comptroller. \\n \\nDepartment heads will be required to execute a certification accepting electronic signature, record keeping \\nand compliance responsibilities under MMARS before any electronic security is granted to a Department.  \\nPlease see Policy Chapter “Department Head Signature Authorization and Electronic Signature for \\nMMARS transactions” for additional information. \\n \\nA Department\\'s Role In Implementing State Finance Law \\n \\nDepartment’s are responsible for carrying out it’s mission in accordance with the Department’s enabling \\nlegislation and General and Special laws, including State Finance Law.  A Department’s mission is defined \\nby both General and Special Laws.  \\n• \\nGeneral Laws identify the Department’s enabling legislation, including the Department’s mission, \\npowers, duties, goals and responsibilities (and for certain Departments, revenue receipt and \\nexpenditure authorization).  \\n• \\nSpecial Laws provide appropriations (funding) to carry out the Department mission, with additional \\nrequirements and restrictions (e.g., specifically earmarked funds for a particular recipient or purpose, \\nand for certain Departments, revenue receipt and expenditure authorization).  \\n• \\nState Finance Law (both General and Special Laws) identifies the manner or process by which a \\nDepartment expends funds in carrying out its mission, and the potential penalties for noncompliance \\nG.L. c. 29, s. 66 – Violations of State Finance Law - Penalties.  \\n \\nRecommendations for Managing within State Finance Law \\nThe following are high level recommended steps to support compliance with State Finance Law when \\nmaking expenditure of public funds.  The Department’s Internal Controls will document detailed protocols, \\nbased upon the unique statutory mandates of a Department, that supports fiscal accountability and risk \\nmitigation.  \\n \\n• \\nDetermine: \\no \\nPlanned activity or expenditure \\no \\n“Legal” authority for planned activity or expenditure (statute, line-item, regulation) \\no \\n“Funding” sufficient to support planned activity or expenditure (line-item appropriation, \\nfederal grant or trust) \\n• \\nIdentify: \\no \\nExpenditure Classification Handbook object class (subsidiary) and object code for the \\nplanned activity or expenditure.  (If funding account subsidiarized by Legislature an object \\ncode must be selected within that subsidiary.  If not subsidiarized, select the most \\nappropriate object code for the activity or expenditure).  \\no \\nComply with applicable requirements identified for the selected object code including \\nprocurement rules, contract boilerplates and supporting documentation. \\no \\nComply with applicable CTR Regulations, policies, and job aids for activity or expenditure. \\n \\n• \\nEvaluate internal controls, ethics issues, conflicts or risks. \\n• \\nConduct purchase or disbursement in accordance with Department protocols and applicable \\nrequirements. \\n• \\nDocument decision-making and retain all supporting materials to respond to public information \\nrequests/audits in accordance with the Statewide Disposal Schedules issued by the Secretary of \\nState Records Conservation Board. . \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law Compliance Appointments and Responsibilities \\n \\nCTR maintains a database of individuals, formally appointed by a Department Head, who are responsible \\nfor the Department’s compliance with various aspects of state finance law.  CTR uses this database to \\ncommunicate information and relies on these individuals as the knowledge base of the Departments in \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 11 of 48 \\ntheir areas of expertise.  These individuals are appointments by the Department Head with very specific \\nduties.  \\n \\nThe Internal Control Officer should be responsible for ensuring that the DHSA, MMARS security, and Key \\nAppointments are up to date, both at the Department and at the Comptroller’s Office.  These \\nresponsibilities are vital for maintaining the series of reliances CTR uses to approve the warrant.  During \\nthis transition period to MMARS and with staff turnover, it is critical that Departments notify CTR promptly \\nof any changes so that we can accurately communicate information to your Department. \\n \\nDepartment Head \\nChief Fiscal Officer \\nPayroll Director \\nInternal Control Officer \\nSecurity Officer \\nMMARS/MMARS Liaison \\nGAAP Liaison \\nGeneral Counsel \\nSingle Audit Liaison \\n \\nDepartment Heads should review the list of personnel who coordinate policy and procedures on their \\nbehalf and reappoint individuals to these roles.  Please review the current list within your Department and \\nforward any changes.  For a description of the responsibilities of each individual, go to State Finance Law \\nCompliance Appointments and Responsibilities.  Each individual listed requires access to the Intranet \\n(either through access behind the firewall or through VPN access if the Department is outside the firewall) \\nin order to retrieve and process documents, policies and other information posted on the Knowledge \\nCenter and MMARS by CTR and OSD.  \\n \\nCTR will communicate important information to these individuals and will rely on these individuals as the \\nknowledge base of the Departments in their areas of expertise.  Please see also Policy chapter \\n“Department Head Signature Authorization and Electronic Signatures for MMARS transactions” for \\nadditional information. \\n \\nDelegation of MMARS transaction Processing (Transaction Delegation) \\n \\nMMARS transaction processing (transaction) delegation enables Departments to process MMARS \\nencumbrance documents for commodities and service contracts within certain dollar limits to Final status \\nwithout prior review by CTR, OSD or another state agency, provided the Department complies with CTR \\nand other identified laws, policies and procedures and the use of specified Contract Forms.  CTR and OSD \\nconduct comprehensive Quality Assurance (QA) reviews on selected procurements and contracts which are \\nalso subject to post audit by SAO, IGO, ETH and AGO. \\n \\nAs stated previously, if the Department is within the Legislative or Judicial Branch or is a non-Executive \\nDepartment or institution, agreeing to comply with state finance laws, including Comptroller laws, \\nregulations, policies and procedures will not by implication extend compliance to Executive Orders or other \\nExecutive Branch directives that this Department would not normally be subject to, unless the ability to \\nuse certain MMARS transactions, system functionality or benefits (such as transaction delegation or \\nincidental purchases) requires compliance with certain minimum requirements (such as the use of \\nstandard Commonwealth boilerplate contracts, or compliance with minimum procedures).  If a Department \\nchooses to take advantage of these benefits, the Department must comply with the minimum \\nrequirements for these benefits, unless otherwise specified. \\n \\nDepartments are afforded greater responsibility and accountability as a result of the delegation of high \\nvolume/low risk transaction encumbrance processing.  Delegation means that a Department will have \\nmore authority and responsibility in processing financial transactions and filing contracts. Increased \\nauthority includes the ability to: \\n \\n1. Process encumbrance transactions up to a certain dollar limit within the Department.  \\n2. Make incidental purchases up to a certain dollar limit without a structured procurement process or \\ncontract.  \\n3. Eliminate individual payments up to a certain dollar limit by using the Commonwealth\\'s credit card.  \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 12 of 48 \\n \\nIncreased responsibility includes creating and maintaining a management environment that: \\n1. Provides the appropriate level of review and approval of encumbrance transactions processed \\nwithin the Departments. \\n2. Provides a framework to achieve best value for incidental purchases without a structured \\nprocurement or contract. \\n3. Trusts and empowers employees to use Commonwealth credit cards for Commonwealth business, \\nthus eliminating multiple processes for incidental transactions.  \\n \\nCTR and OSD conduct comprehensive Quality Assurance (QA) reviews on selected procurements and \\ncontracts.  Contracts are also subject to post audit by SAO, IGO, ETH and AGO.  Please see Policy Chapter \\n“Delegation of MMARS Processing Authority” for additional information.  \\n \\nExpenditure Classification Handbook \\n \\nThis handbook includes the object code descriptions and instructions regarding the encumbering and \\nexpenditure of all funds.  The object codes in this Handbook are used for all expenditures of the \\nCommonwealth regardless of whether the payment is to employees, contractors, individuals, recipients, \\nbeneficiaries, political sub-divisions, etc.  Object codes fulfill tax reporting obligations and identify \\nprocurement, contract, legal authority, transaction document and other key information. \\n \\nDepartments are responsible, PRIOR to incurring an obligation, to ensure that they \\nhave identified the appropriate object class and object code for the given obligation, \\nand that they comply with identified requirements or restrictions.   \\n \\n \\nRevenues - Department Acceptance And Expenditure  \\nThe following Constitutional, General and Special Laws govern a Department’s acceptance of revenue and \\ndetermine the Department’s ability to expend that revenue: \\n• \\nMassachusetts Constitution: Article LXIII. Section 1. \"Collection of Revenue. - All money \\nreceived on account of the commonwealth from any source whatsoever shall be paid into the \\ntreasury thereof.\"  \\n• \\nG.L. c. 30, s. 27: \"Except as otherwise expressly provided, all fees or other money received on \\naccount of the commonwealth shall be paid daily into the treasury thereof.\"  \\n• \\nThis means that the total revenues collected by a Department must be deposited and \\naccounted for in the state accounting system (MMARS).  \\n• \\nIf a Contractor assists a Department in the collection of revenue (e.g., debt collection \\nagency, revenue maximization Contractor, or a cost avoidance Contractor) the total of all \\nrevenues collected must first be deposited and accounted for in the state accounting system \\nprior to payment being made to the Contractor. (i.e., no \"netting\" of revenues and fees). \\n• \\nG.L. c. 10, s. 17B Unless otherwise provided by law, all moneys received by a Department shall be \\ndeposited with the state treasurer (subject to the approval of the Governor) and expended, subject \\nto appropriation.  \\n• \\nThis means that a Department can receive funds from any source (gift, grant or bequest) \\nbut must have specific legislative authority (language) to expend the funds (subject to \\nappropriation).  \\n• \\nExamples of specific legislative authority (language) authorizing receipt and \\nexpenditure of funds include:  \\n• \\n\"…and may expend such funds without further appropriation…\", or  \\n• \\n\"…and may expend such funds for the purposes of this section…\" \\n• \\nIf a General or Special law is silent as to the ability of the Department to expend the \\nfunds, or states that expenditures are \"subject to appropriation\", the Department \\nmay not obligate or expend the funds received until the Legislature authorizes \\n(appropriates) the expenditure of fund through a GAA, SAA or other Act. \\n• \\nG.L. c. 6A, s. 6. Subject to approval of ANF, a secretary may apply for and accept funds, grants, \\nbequests, gifts or contributions, from any person and expend in accordance with law. Approval of \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 13 of 48 \\nan expendable trust by ANF is governed by 801 CMR 50.00 Expendable Trust Regulation.  Contact \\nthe Legal Division of ANF for more information. The Trust language determines how the funding \\nmay be expended.  \\n• \\nG.L. c. 29, s. 29E, 815 CMR 8.00 and annual Special Laws provide the authorization for contingent \\nfee contracts for non-tax revenue maximization and cost avoidance projects.  \\n• \\nExample of Trust established by General Law: ex. G.L. c. 29D - Health Care Security Trust  \\n• \\nExample of Retained Revenue Account established by Special Law: Chapter 159 of \\nthe Acts of 2000, section 2. ss. 1775-0900 \"The Operational Services Division may expend \\nrevenues in an amount not to exceed $100,000 collected pursuant to chapter 449 of the \\nacts of 1984… from the sale of federal surplus property\"  \\n• \\nExample of Interdepartmental Chargeback established by Special Law: Chapter 159 \\nof the Acts of 2000 section 2B. ss. 1100-1108 – \"For the office of dispute resolution for the \\ncosts of mediation and another services provided to certain agencies \\n…………………….…………………….$300,000 \\n• \\nNOTE: Irrespective of source of funding, Departments are required to encumber and expend funds \\nin accordance with state finance law requirements identified by CTR (e.g., Expenditure \\nClassification Handbook; Comptroller Knowledge Center Policies; Fiscal Year Updates and Fiscal \\nYear Closing and Opening Instructions.  See also the policies under Non-Tax Revenue. \\n \\nDepartment Procurement Levels  \\n \\nIn order to clarify and standardize the Commonwealth’s procurement practices, all state Departments \\nhave been classified into one of three “Procurement Levels” based upon governing statutes and \\nprocurement laws.   \\n \\nLevel I Departments – Legislative, Judicial Branch and other Exempt Departments  \\nLevel II Departments – Executive Branch - Non-Executive Departments  \\nLevel III Departments – Executive Branch – Executive Departments  \\n \\nDepartments by Procurement Level Table \\n \\nProcurement Requirements per Level  \\n \\nFor procurement purposes, the requirements for each of the Department Procurement Levels differs \\nprimarily for contracts for “commodities and services” which fall under OSD’s jurisdiction and 801 CMR \\n21.00.  The details of procurement requirements for commodities and services are found in this Policy and \\nOSD’s Procurement Information Center (PIC).  \\n  \\nThe requirements for state grants and federal subgrants, subsidies, Interdepartmental \\nService Agreements (ISAs) and Interdepartmental Chargebacks are the same for all \\nDepartments irrespective of Procurement Level.  Please see the Policy Chapter for each \\ntype of Contract for additional information and requirements. \\n \\n \\nThe following sections outline the particular requirements for commodities and services procurements for \\neach of the Department procurement levels.  \\n \\nLEVEL I: EXEMPT DEPARTMENTS  \\nLevel I Procurement Requirements – Commodity and Service Contracts \\n \\n• \\nLevel I Departments are exempt from G.L. c. 7, § 22, G.L. c. 30, § 51 and G.L. c. 30, § 52 \\nalthough Exempt Departments are encouraged to conduct procurements consistent with 801CMR \\n21.00 and the Procurement Information Center (PIC).

Chapter 7, Section 22 under the jurisdiction of the \\nPurchasing Agent (OSD).  Incidental Purchases are one-time, unanticipated, non-recurring purchases of \\ncommodities (goods) or services that are not available from a Statewide Contract.  Executive (Level III) \\nand any other Department that follows 801 CMR 21.00 for its internal procurement policy must comply \\nwith the incidental purchase requirements outlined in the OSD Procurement Information Center (PIC) \\nand the “Incidental Purchase Quick Reference Guide”.  \\n \\nNon-Executive (Level II) Department procurements of commodities and services are governed by G.L. \\nChapter 7, Section 22.  Level II Departments that do not adopt 801 CMR 21.00 as internal procurement \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 17 of 48 \\npractices must have written internal incidental purchase procedures that comply with the OSD policies and \\nprocedures for incidental purchases. \\n \\nExempt (Level I) Departments are not subject to G.L. c. 7, § 22 or the OSD policies and procedures for \\nincidental purchases.  However, the use of incidental purchases is a privilege granted to Departments \\nbased upon assurances of state finance law compliance.  As part of obtaining MMARS security Department \\nHeads certified that their Departments would comply with all applicable laws, regulation, policies and \\nprocedures.  In addition, Level I Department Heads also certified that if the Department chose to take \\nadvantage of incidental purchases the Department would comply with CTR policies related to incidental \\npurchases and MMARS transaction processing delegation.  For Level I Departments, the CTR policy for \\nincidental purchases requires any Level I Department that chooses to use incidental purchases to have \\nwritten internal incidental purchase procedures that are consistent with the “one-time, unanticipated, non-\\nrecurring“ use and dollar threshold restrictions set for incidental purchases by OSD for Executive (Level \\nIII) and Non-Executive (Level II) Departments. \\n \\nLevel I and II Departments can identify the types of commodities and services eligible for incidental \\npurchases, and the Departments will not be required to use Statewide Contracts first if available for the \\ntype of purchase required.  Incidental Purchases do not require a competitive procurement or contract.  \\nThe vendor’s invoice is the minimum necessary documentation for payment.  Ongoing or recurring \\npurchases of commodities (goods) or services (performance that recurs annually) are not Incidental \\nPurchases and must be procured using a competitive procurement.  \\n \\nThe GAE is the encumbrance for incidental purchases, although no encumbrance is necessary.  If a \\nDepartment chooses to encumber funds using a PC or CT document for incidental purchases then a \\nStandard Contract Form and Commonwealth Terms and Conditions must also be completed and retained \\nin the Department’s procurement file.  \\n \\nFor more detailed information Departments should consult the OSD Procurement Information Center \\n(PIC) and the “Incidental Purchase Quick Reference Guide”  \\n \\nDocumentation Requirements for Incidental Purchases \\n \\nPurchases which do not exceed the incidental purchase limit and are not available from a statewide \\ncontract may be done without a competitive procurement. The encumbrance transaction for incidental \\npurchases is the GAE (General Accounting Encumbrance document) and the payment transaction is the \\nINP (Incidental Payment document). For most incidental purchases, only the invoice is required. On the \\nother hand, Departments may determine it is in their best interest to execute a Commonwealth Terms and \\nConditions and Standard Contract Form. If they elect to do a CT (Contract Encumbrance document), RPO \\n(Recurring Payment Order), or PC (Commodity Purchase Order), then both of these forms are required. \\nEach Department should develop internal controls on procurement and documentation that are \\nappropriate to the nature of incidental purchases that the Department is likely to encounter. Please see \\nthe associated guidance entitled Incidental Purchasing Policy Guidance under OSD’s Procurement \\nInformation Center (PIC).. \\n \\nINDIVIDUAL CONTRACTORS – CONTRACT EMPLOYEE OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR \\n \\nThis policy, which is jointly issued by the Operational Services Division, Office of the Comptroller and \\nHuman Resources Division, highlights the differences between the two types of individual workers: \\ncontract employees and independent contractors. It provides guidance to Departments in determining \\nwhether to hire a contract employee or to contract with an independent Contractor and then provides \\nguidance pertaining to the recruitment and contract execution for contract employees. This guidance \\nincludes the Commonwealth’s three-part test, which incorporates the requirements of state and federal \\nlaw and which must be utilized by Departments in determining whether an individual is a contract \\nemployee or an independent Contractor. \\n \\nWhen a Department requires the services of an individual, it must determine, before acquiring the \\nservices, if the service is a competitive procurement exception (contract employee) or if it must conduct a \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 18 of 48 \\ncompetitive procurement (independent Contractor). In addition, when a Department has conducted a \\ncompetitive procurement, which was not specifically for the services of an individual but which has \\nresulted in the selection of an individual, the Department must review the specific working circumstances \\nof the contract and the individual\\'s work status to determine if the individual will be deemed a contract \\nemployee or independent Contractor in their working relationship with the Department. \\n \\nFor more detailed guidance for determining whether to hire a contract employee or to contract with an \\nindependent Contractor, and guidance pertaining to the recruitment and contract execution for contract \\nemployees, See the policy Chapter under either “Contracts” or “Payroll” for  “Individual Contractors – \\nContract Employee vs. Independent Contractor”. \\n \\nEmployment Status Form (Combined State and Federal Tests for Employment Status) \\n \\nAn Employment Status Form has been developed to assist Departments in two ways:  \\n1. To make the determination PRIOR to the procurement of services, as to whether the type of work \\nto be performed will trigger an employment relationship (contract employee) or a non-employment \\nrelationship (independent Contractor) in order to determine the proper procurement method to be \\nused to acquire the services, and \\n \\n2. To confirm the employment status when a contract is signed with an individual Contractor selected \\nfrom either an RFR (independent Contractor) or posting (contract employee), which is a required \\nattachment to the Standard Contract Form. \\n \\nThe checklist on the Employment Status Form reconciles the Federal IRS 20 factors (which are focused \\nprimarily on whether an employee falls under the “supervision and control” of a Department) with the \\nstricter Massachusetts presumption that an individual will be considered a contract employee “unless” the \\nindividual passes all three parts of the Massachusetts three-part test. \\n \\nWhile the IRS factors consider the work context and the overall balance of the 20 factors, the \\nMassachusetts law requires that the employer/employee relationship be definitively established. The \\nMassachusetts Attorney General has interpreted this test to be rigid, thus resulting in the presumption \\nthat an individual Contractor will be considered a contract employee unless the three-part test under G.L. \\nc. 149, s. 148B is met. The burden is on the Department to defend a determination of independent \\nContractor status.  Massachusetts law imposes strict penalties when a worker is misclassified.  Therefore, \\na Department must complete the “Employment Status Form” in order to certify the status for all individual \\ncontractors and attach it to the Standard Contract Form. \\n \\nThe Employment Status Form is available under Forms-Payroll and LCM in the CTR Website and \\nas part of the policy “Individual Contractors – Contract Employee vs. Independent Contractor”. \\n \\nPosting or Procurement? \\n \\nA Department does not always know in advance whether services can be best performed by an individual \\nContractor or by a company or firm. Therefore, whenever services are being performed, the Department \\nshould make the following determinations: \\n \\n1. Identify the Business Needs of the Department: The hiring Department should develop \\nperformance specifications for the services necessary to meet the Department’s business needs, \\nincluding where the work needs to be performed, the level of control and supervision that will be \\nrequired for performance, whether the work hours or schedule will be set by the Department or the \\nContractor, whether the work is performed as part of or outside the usual course of business of the \\nDepartment. \\n \\n2. Apply the Commonwealth Three-Part Test to the Business Needs: (Employment Status \\nForm): The Department must determine if the type of work to be performed can be performed by a \\nfirm or an individual and if the type of oversight relationship will trigger an employer-employee \\nrelationship or that of an independent Contractor. To make this determination, the Department must \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 19 of 48 \\nreview the Employment Status Form to determine if an employer-employee relationship will be \\ncreated if an individual is selected for performance, as follows: \\n \\na. \\nIf the work can be performed by a firm or an individual, or the Department is unsure of how best to \\nperform the requisite service, and the review of the Employment Status Form 3-part test indicates \\nthat there will not be an employer-employee relationship, the Department is required to conduct a \\nprocurement for these services. See How to Do a Competitive Procurement in the OSD \\nProcurement Information Center (www.mass.gov/osd). \\n \\nb. \\nIf the work can only be performed by an individual, and the review of the Employment Status Form \\n3-part test indicates that there will be an employer-employee relationship, the Department is \\nrequired to post the contract notice for a contract employee, as outlined below. \\n \\nCommonwealth Three-Part Test \\n \\nCurrent employment law establishes separate tests for determining employment status under both state \\nand federal law. State law, G.L. c. 149, s. 148B, establishes a three-part test that presumes an individual \\nis a contract employee unless: \\n \\n1. The individual is free from control and direction in connection with the performance of the service, \\nboth under his contract for the performance of service and in fact. \\n \\n2. The service is performed outside the usual course of the business of the employer. \\n \\n3. The individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or \\nbusiness of the same nature as that involved in the service performed. \\n \\nThis test is a much stricter test than the federal IRS SS-8 test, which Departments have used in the past \\nto determine employment status. Any individuals who were classified as independent contractors using the \\nSS-8 test should be reassessed to determine whether they are also independent contractors under the \\nCommonwealth’s laws. If the individual would be classified as an independent Contractor under the SS-8 \\ntest, but as a contract employee under the Commonwealth Three-Part test, the individual should be \\nreclassified as a contract employee. The Attorney General’s Office may impose penalties if the three-part \\ntest shows that an individual should be a contract employee, and the individual was misclassified as an \\nindependent Contractor. \\n \\n \\nContract Employees (Procurement Exception Under 801 CMR 21.05(6)) \\n \\nThe hiring of contract employees is a competitive procurement exception under 801 CMR 21.05(6) since \\nindividuals deemed contract employees will be hired under the normal personnel procedures of the \\nDepartment.  \\n \\nDetermine the compensation of the contract: Departments should determine the rate or range of \\ncompensation based on the performance and qualifications requirements and available funding.  \\nDepartments may adjust the rate or range to reflect to lack of fringe benefits for contract employees and \\nthe selected candidate’s qualifications.  Then, Departments should determine the total compensation for \\nthe anticipated contract duration. \\n \\nPost the contract notice: Departments should post, advertise or solicit contract candidates as deemed \\nappropriate, e.g., colleges and universities, newspapers, trade journals, electronically (MassCareers), and \\nin accordance with any internal procedures on recruitment developed for the Department. The posting \\nshould include the description of performance requirements or functions, any minimum qualifications, the \\ncompensation rate or range, expected duration and possible options to renew. It should also include \\ninstructions for how and when candidates should respond to the posting. \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 20 of 48 \\nSelect the Contractor: Selection of a contract employee should be in accordance with the Department’s \\nstandard interview process. The evaluation should take into account the performance requirements and \\nminimum qualifications of the posting. See HRD’s Model Hiring Plan, Structured Interview Guidelines. See \\nthe Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination Pre-Employment Inquiries Fact Sheet for additional \\ninformation on appropriate interview questions and topics. \\n \\nContract Forms.  Contract employees must execute the Commonwealth Terms and Conditions and the \\nStandard Contract Form.  The attachments should include a copy of the contract posting or an alternative \\nattachment containing the description of the contract performance, any minimum qualifications, the \\ncompensation rate or range and a copy of the Contractor’s résumé (or statement of qualifications).  \\nInclude completed Employment Status Form.   \\n \\nAmendments.  After contract execution, annual or other options to renew or amendments to the contract \\nare exercised at the Department’s option in accordance with the duration listed in the posting by executing \\na Standard Contract Amendment Form prior to the termination date of the contract.   \\n \\nPayroll System Requirements for Contract Employees.   \\n \\n• \\nContract employees must be paid through the state payroll system that automatically makes tax \\ndeductions and alternative retirement contributions. \\n• \\nContract employees are subject to alternative retirement contributions under COBRA 1990. \\n• \\nContract employee labor will be distributed the same way regular employee labor is distributed.  By \\ndefault, all charges will be attributed to the HR/CMS position accounting line (Department, Unit, and \\nAppropriation).  If the position distribution needs to be changed or additional data needs to be \\ncaptured for labor history reporting, a default distribution, pay period exception, or labor adjustment \\nshould be created in LCM. Contract employee payroll payments will be incorporated into LCM \\npredictive/production payroll reports so that Departments can monitor and manage funded/unfunded \\npayroll accounts. LCM Labor History and CIW reports can be used to track contract employee payroll \\nexpenses. \\n• \\nThe Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) makes it illegal for an employer to hire an \\nunauthorized worker.  Employers must comply with this requirement by verifying the identity and right \\nto work of all employees hired after November 6, 1986.  Prior to hiring any individual, employers can \\nprotect themselves by obtaining proof of the right to work in the U.S. This proof of right to work is \\nknown as Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification. This form is available at: Form I-9, \\nEmployment Eligibility Verification. \\n• \\nMake sure the name matches Social Security Administration records.  Correct names and social \\nsecurity numbers (SSN) on W-2 wage reports are the keys to successful processing of the \\nCommonwealth’s annual wage report submission. Not only can the Commonwealth be subject to \\npenalties when employee names and SSNs don\\'t match Social Security Administration records, but \\nalso unmatched wage reports can cause earnings that are not posted to your employees\\' records. To \\nverify the name and SSN match, call the SSA toll-free number for employers - 1-800-772-6270 \\nprovide Social Security Number, Date of Birth and Gender. The Commonwealth EIN is 04-6002284. \\nDouble check to make sure you have entered the SSN correctly into the payroll system. \\n• \\nUpon hiring or rehiring an individual verify Medicare Status. For Rehires verify that a ‘break in service’ \\nhas not occurred. Validate Income and Medicare taxes are appropriately withheld from wages paid to \\ncontract employees, in amounts determined by the employees’ withholding certificates and \\ngovernmental withholding tax tables”. \\n• \\nContract employees receive a W-2 for state and federal tax purposes.   \\n \\nMassachusetts Labor Relations Commission Test: \\n \\nFor the purposes of determining collective bargaining status, the Massachusetts Labor Relations \\nCommission does not distinguish between a contract employee and an independent Contractor.  Only \\nthose individuals who meet the Labor Relations Commission’s standard of independent Contractor will be \\nexempt from the definition of employee pursuant to G.L. c. 150E and, as such, exempt from union \\nmembership.  In determining whether an employee is an independent Contractor, the Labor Relations \\nCommission examines whether the alleged employer retains control over the worker.  In analyzing the \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 21 of 48 \\ncontrol issue, the Labor Relations Commission examines the duties of the workers, the type of supervision \\nthey receive, how the employer treats the workers, and the method in which the workers are paid.  The \\nfunding source for the position is irrelevant to the Labor Relations Commission’s analysis. \\n \\n \\nFixed Assets – Acquisition Policy and Procurement Considerations when purchasing durable \\ncommodities (applies to all Departments) \\n \\nUnless otherwise specified, the policies identified for the acquisition of fixed assets including durable \\ncommodities apply to all branches of state government.  Acquisition includes cash purchase, receipt of a \\ndonation, construction, rental, license, term lease, lease purchase (TELP) or eminent domain, regardless \\nof the source of funds used.  All acquisitions of fixed assets must be recorded in accordance with existing \\nlaws and policies of the Commonwealth.  The Commonwealth owns an asset when the full title of the asset \\nrests with the Commonwealth.  \\n \\n \\nAll purchases of commodities such as furniture, vehicles, equipment, computer \\nsoftware, electrical and computer components with a value exceeding $1,000 must be \\nrecorded as inventory and when exceeding $50,000 must be recorded as fixed assets \\nin MMARS.   \\n \\nDepartment must comply with Fixed Asset - Acquisition Policy for these types of \\npurchases, and for guidance on the appropriate considerations for rentals, leases, \\noutright purchases and Tax Exempt Lease Purchases (TELPs). \\n \\n \\nThe cost of purchasing an asset includes all costs necessary to put that asset into existing use and \\nlocation, including but not limited to freight, insurance and installation (i.e., ancillary costs). These costs \\nmay include legal costs, eminent domain costs or environmental remediation. The custodial responsibilities \\nof an asset will reside within a particular Department.  All GAAP fixed asset transactions must be entered \\nin MMARS. \\n \\nThe Fixed Asset – Acquisition Policy outlines the requirements that apply to fixed assets, including \\nprocurement considerations and recording responsibilities.  Departments that purchase durable \\ncommodities are required to conduct these purchases in accordance with the relevant procurement \\nrequirements AND the Fixed Asset Acquisition Policy.  Please see Policy Chapter “Fixed Asset – \\nAcquisition Policy for additional information and requirements. \\n \\nSTATE GRANTS AND FEDERAL SUBGRANTS PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS. \\nA formal public notice of a grant application will be required under 815 CMR 2.00 whenever a Department \\nplans to disburse discretionary grant funding of state appropriated funds which do not specifically \\nidentify the grant recipients to receive funding and: \\na. the total anticipated value of any single grant award may exceed $50,000 for the duration of \\nthe grant or grant program, or \\nb. the pool of potential eligible grant recipients includes, or may include, non-public entities, or \\nc. the total available funds for disbursement in any fiscal year exceeds $200,000;  \\nunless the grant meets an authorized exception.   \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nLegislative or Legal Exemption - earmarked or designated grantees; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nIncidental Grants - small $ - one time, non-recurring grants; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nInterim Grant - to complete performance or to prevent a lapse in performance until a new grant \\napplication process is completed; \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 22 of 48 \\n\\uf0a7 \\nBest value –a formal posting on Comm-PASS or other pubic posting of a Notice of Intent to Award \\na grant(s) on Comm-PASS with justification of why the selection of the grantee(s) without a \\nprocurement is the best value common sense decision, as efficient, fair and reasonable and in the \\nbest interests of the Department and the Commonwealth. \\n \\nState and Federal Subgrants are subject to all other contract and accounting requirements as any other \\ncontract. Federal Subgrants may have additional federal reporting and federal grant requirements.   \\nPlease see Policy Chapter “Contracts – State Grants and Federal Sub-grants”.  Procurement \\nexceptions do not apply to Subsidies, ISAs and Chargebacks. Please see Chapters for each Contract type \\nfor additional information regarding procurement exceptions.   \\n \\nRequirements for Vendors Receiving Federal Funds (DUNS Numbers) \\n \\nThe United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires all vendors (defined as sole \\nproprietor, corporation, profit and non-profit, partnership municipal or regional government, that receive \\nfederal grant funds have their Dunn and Bradstreet Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number \\nrecorded with and subsequently reported by the granting agency.  To meet this requirement, the MA-W-9 \\nForm includes the field DUNS number.  All vendors must submit their DUNS number using the form MA-W-\\n9.  Any entity that does not have a DUNS number can apply for one on-line at www.DNB.com under the \\n“D&B D-U-N-Number” Tab or at: \\nhttps://eupdate.dnb.com/requestoptions.asp?cm_re=HomepageB*TopNav*DUNSNumberTab.  Individuals \\ncannot obtain and do not need a DUNS number,. i.e., foster parents who are paid using their social \\nsecurity number.  Departments should enter or update using a Vendor/Customer Entry (VCC) or a Vendor \\nCustomer Modification (VCM). \\n \\nUse of the Commonwealth DUNS numbers by non-Commonwealth entities is Prohibited – \\nIssuance of the Commonwealth’s DUNS numbers to non-Commonwealth entities such as sub-recipients \\nis prohibited.  If this is done, the Commonwealth may be put into a position of being reported as being \\nprimarily responsible for a secondary entity’s activities.  See The Use of DUNS Numbers in Federal Grants \\nPolicy.  If a Contractor has multiple DUNS numbers, the Contractor should provide the primary number \\nlisted with the Federal government’s Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at: http://www.ccr.gov. \\n \\nFederal Grant Funding  \\n \\nSpecial requirements must be met when accepting and expending federal grant funds, including disbursing \\nfederal grant funds through a federal subgrant or through an Interdepartmental Service Agreement (ISA).  \\nDepartments are required to carefully follow cost accounting requirements for coding federal grants.  See \\nFederal Grants and Cost Accounting Page on the web site for applicable policies, job aids and document \\nprofiles.  See the policy chapters on “State Grants and Federal Subgrants” and “Interdepartmental \\nService Agreements (ISAs)” for additional information and requirements for use of federal grant \\nfunding \\n. \\nCONTRACT EXECUTION AND FILING \\nThe following sections identify the requirements for the use of contracts, contract execution, filing, and \\ncontract management.  \\n \\nTypes of Contracts \\n \\nThe following is a listing of the most common types of contracts. This section contains many of the general \\nrequirements that apply to these types of contracts (with the exception of construction and real property \\nleases.)  Please see the Contracts Policy Chapter for each contract type for additional requirements and \\ninformation.  The Expenditure Classification Handbook identifies the required Contract Form to be used for \\neach object code, if applicable. \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nSubsidies (Non-discretionary Legislatively Mandated Payment to Specified Recipient(s)) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nCommodities and Services (Including Health and Human Services, Leases, TELPS, Consultant \\nContracts, Incidental Purchases and Statewide Contracts) \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 23 of 48 \\n\\uf0a7 \\nGrants and Federal Subgrants (including Federal Subgrants and Incidental Grants) (Financial \\nAssistance for a Public Purpose) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nInterdepartmental Service Agreements (Joint Venture between Departments) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nInterdepartmental Chargebacks (Legislatively authorized service fees or charges) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nHorizontal Construction Contracts (Roads, bridges) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nVertical Construction Contracts (Buildings) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nReal Property Leases (Space or land leases) \\n \\nContract Forms \\n \\nAll Level II and Level III Departments, and any Level I Departments that take advantage of MMARS \\ntransaction processing delegation (transaction delegation) are required to use standard Commonwealth \\ncontract boilerplates.  The following are the most common standard Commonwealth contract boilerplates.  \\nPlease see Policy Chapters for each type of Contract for additional requirements and information.  Forms \\nare available under the Procurement/Contract Page under “Forms”: \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nCommonwealth Terms and Conditions Form \\n\\uf0a7 \\nCommonwealth Terms and Conditions for Human and Social Services (Level III - Executive Only) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nCommonwealth Standard Contract Form \\n\\uf0a7 \\nPurchase Order for Commodities and/or Services \\n\\uf0a7 \\nChange in Contractor Identify Form (Change in business structure or contract assignment)  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nInterdepartmental Service Agreement Form \\n\\uf0a7 \\nSubsidy Agreement \\n\\uf0a7 \\nConstruction Contracts (vertical) and Real Property Leasing see the Division of Capital Asset \\nManagement Forms.   \\n \\nContract Form Exceptions \\nThere are a few exceptions to the general requirement of using Commonwealth boilerplate contracts.  \\nThese circumstances are rare and should be negotiated sparinG.L.y, as follows: \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAlternative contracts are acceptable for student interns.  Although primarily an issue with \\nhigher education institutions which routinely employ student interns as part of normal business and \\nas part of work study curriculum, any Department may use an alternative contract form for student \\ninterns.  If the student is covered by G.L. c. 258, the commonwealth has some protection, \\nhowever, a contract which offers liability protection and requires the student to comply with \\nDepartment policies and procedures in accordance with law is sufficient.  Departments are \\nencouraged to review alternative student intern contracts with CTR and/or OSD for comments. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAlternative contracts are acceptable for contracts with the federal government.  The \\nfederal government, when performing contract work for the Commonwealth, routinely refuses to \\nsign the Commonwealth boilerplates.  Upon review of Department legal counsel and CTR and/or \\nOSD counsel, a Department may develop its own alternative form to memorialize performance \\nrequirements or sign a form prescribed by the federal government.  Agreements with quasi-federal \\nentities are not included within this exception. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAlternative contracts are acceptable for contracts with multi-state collaboratives.  In \\nsome cases, a Department will be one of several states included in a multi-state, or state-federal \\ncollaborative.  In these circumstances the Department may execute an alternative contract or \\nMemorandum of Understanding, provided the document has been reviewed by Department counsel \\nand CTR and/or OSD to ensure that signature would not bind the Commonwealth to obligations in \\nviolation of state law, or attempt to obligate the Commonwealth to appropriate funds in a future \\nfiscal year(s) for the collaborative. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nWaiver of use of contract in emergency or special circumstances.  In certain very rare \\ncircumstances, a waiver of the use of a contract may be necessary.  For example, in emergency, \\ncritical need or exceptional circumstances as outlined in 801 CMR 21.08 (2) funding for emergency \\nor special performance it is anticipated that a contract will be executed with the Contractor \\nproviding the emergency service.  In the event a contract can not be executed by the parties \\ncontemporaneously with the need for the performance, the Department shall not be required to \\nretroactively attempt to have a contract signed.  Instead, the Department shall follow the contract \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 24 of 48 \\nsettlement and release process.  This remedy should not be assumed to be a routine remedy for \\nadministrative failure to obtain timely executed contracts, and use of settlements will be strictly \\nreviewed as part of quality assurance reviews by CTR and OSD, and will be subject to audit.  This \\nsection applies to any type of contract. \\n \\nProhibition against Execution of Vendor Contracts \\n \\nCTR and OSD support the Office of the Attorney General’s recommendation against the execution of any \\nvendor or contract boilerplate, or the acceptance of vendor invoices or purchase orders with contractual \\nterms.  Many of these forms contain terms which contradict standard Commonwealth boilerplate terms, \\nprovide a benefit to the vendor to the detriment of the Commonwealth, restrict the AGO’s ability to \\nsuccessfully defend or litigate on behalf of the Commonwealth or severely limit contract recoveries for \\nbreach of contract.   \\n \\nThe AGO has approved the use of the Commonwealth Terms and Conditions (T&C and T&C HHS) for the \\nuse by Commonwealth Departments as well as other listed Commonwealth boilerplates.  A vendor \\ncontract may be attached unsigned to a Commonwealth contract if the document contains relevant \\nperformance requirements, however, conflicting terms should be crossed out.  Even if terms are not \\ncrossed out, conflicting terms will be superseded by the Commonwealth contract terms.   \\n \\nDepartments are strongly advised not to execute vendor contracts, even if a vendor requests signature \\nin return for the vendor’s signature of the Commonwealth contracts.  Departments may be faced with \\nunusual circumstances in which a Contractor refuses to sign the Commonwealth contracts, conditions the \\nsignature on material changes to the contract, or demands the Commonwealth’s signature on a vendor \\nContractor or the vendor will not provide performance.  These circumstances should be immediately \\ncommunicated to the Department’s legal office for resolution.   \\n \\nThe issue of vendor contracts arises more often when Departments are procuring incidental purchases in \\nwhich no procurement or contract is required (such as being required to execute a rental contract for a \\nshort term rental of equipment, furniture or space.)  Even though a Commonwealth contract boilerplate is \\nnot required, this does not mean that signing a vendor contract is acceptable.  On the contrary, if any \\ncontract is used, it must be a Commonwealth boilerplate, not a vendor contract.  Since Departments are \\nultimately in control of their business decisions, Departments that choose to execute a vendor contract, \\nunder any circumstance, assume any risks, costs or liabilities associated with this decision and the AGO \\nmay choose not to represent the Department in any resulting litigation.   \\n \\nInsurance and Indemnification \\n \\nDepartments are prohibited from insuring Commonwealth property under G.L. c. 29, § 30 absent specific \\nlegislative authorization.  This means that a Department is prohibited from insuring its property or \\nequipment from damage or loss.  The Commonwealth is \"self-insured\", which means that it does not \\npurchase separate personal and property liability insurance, but pays for damages through its own funding \\nappropriated by the Legislature. \\n \\nIn addition to being prohibited from insuring its own property, a Department may not insure property it \\ndoes not own (lease or TELP).  The leasing company is responsible for insuring any property it owns and \\nleases to the Commonwealth.  The leasing company may calculate a lease payment to include its cost for \\nhaving insurance, but may not tack on a separate fee for insurance, or require a Department to obtain \\nseparate insurance for leased property.   \\n \\nMassachusetts employees are covered under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act under G.L. c. 258 which \\ncovers liability for personal and property damages caused by the Commonwealth in the course of its \\nofficial duties.  Claims that are properly presented and finalized are paid by the Commonwealth in \\naccordance with this statute, subject to appropriation and available funds in the Liability Management \\nReduction  Fund (created under G.L. c. 7A, § 16.   \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 25 of 48 \\nVendors requesting that the Commonwealth provide an insurance policy or purchase insurance for an \\nevent, equipment, etc. should be informed that the Commonwealth is self-insured and does not pay for \\nadditional insurance.  The Commonwealth does not provide certificates or other proof of insurance since \\nthis is provided for in the statute G.L. c. 258 (which has the same affect).  Therefore, providing this \\ninformation should obviate the need for providing further proof of insurance. \\n \\nThe Massachusetts Constitution mandates that all claims for money due and owing are \"subject to \\nappropriation\".  Any language in a contract which attempts to obligate the Commonwealth to indemnify or \\notherwise obligate the Commonwealth to pay damages at some future date (in advance of an \\nappropriation) is deemed void.  Therefore, no contract may contain language obligating the \\nCommonwealth to pay damages or to indemnify a Contractor (absent legislative language to the contrary) \\nwithout an appropriation.  The Commonwealth Terms and Conditions contains language stating that \\ncontractors may be indemnified “in accordance with law”, which means that if the Commonwealth is found \\nliable for a breach or other damages that are awarded to a Contractor through litigation or other contract \\nclaim, the Contractor will be paid “subject to appropriation” by the Legislature.  There can be no \\nguaranteed entitlement to indemnification or damages.  A Contractor must always file a claim and prove \\ndamages. \\n \\nThese restrictions do not prohibit a Department from negotiating as part of a contract an amount or \\ncalculation of liquidated damages that could be paid, subject to appropriation, in the event certain \\ndamages occurred and were proven by a Contractor.  This language would be binding only as to the \\n“amount” or “calculation” to be used if damages are proven, and would not be binding upon the \\nCommonwealth as an entitlement to payment.  There is still no guarantee of payment since the Contractor \\nmust still bring a claim for damages, and the Contractor must prove damages, and any payment for \\nsubstantiated damages would be subject to appropriation by the Legislature.    \\n \\nDepartments may not negotiate language that limits the Commonwealth’s right to indemnification or limits \\na Contractor’s liability for damages, except as authorized in the Standard Contract Form.  The Attorney \\nGeneral’s Office has determined, as the Authorized Attorney for the Commonwealth, that the right to full \\nrecoupment of contract damages and personal and property damage to the Commonwealth is required \\nand may not be reduced, except as authorized under the “Limitation of Liability for Information \\nTechnology Contracts” section of the Standard Contract Form.  \\n \\nAttempts to reduce the Commonwealth’s rights to indemnification or reducing a Contractor’s liability for \\ndamages shifts the risk of loss from the Contractor (who is in a better position to insure for these \\ndamages) to the Commonwealth.  In the event of a loss, the Commonwealth would need to cover the \\nlosses with appropriated dollars and might not be able to recoup the full extent of damages caused by the \\nContractor.  Insuring for contract damages, and for personal and property damages to the Commonwealth \\nare a normal business expense that is properly borne by a Contractor and which are costs that are \\nprorated across all contracts a Contractor has, not just the Commonwealth contracts.  Therefore, having \\nsufficient insurance to cover damages should already be factored into contract pricing and Departments \\nshould be wary of Contractors claiming that having this insurance “costs the Commonwealth more money” \\nsince this type of insurance should be already be in place for all Contractor customers.  .  \\n   \\nSee Contract Negotiation section below.   \\n \\nQuestions on insurance or indemnification should always be referred to the Department’s legal counsel.  \\n \\nContract Attachments \\n \\nContract attachments and contents vary depending upon the type of contract.  Please see the policy \\nchapter for each type of contract for details regarding contents and attachments.  Please see also the \\nPolicy Chapter “Quick Reference – Commodities and Services, Grants, Subsidies, ISAs and \\nChargebacks” and the “Quick Reference” for each of the contract types.

The following sections provide guidance on negotiating contracts with \\nselected bidders. Departments are encouraged to include programmatic, Affirmative Market Program \\nCoordinators or their designees and fiscal and legal staff during contract negotiations. \\n \\nIn addition, Departments should remember that, pursuant to G.L. c. 106, s. 2-205, bidders’ \\nresponses/bids made in response to a Request for Response will only remain in effect for 90 days from the \\ndate of bid submission. If it appears during contract negotiations that the negotiations may cause this 90 \\nday effective bid period to lapse, then the Procurement Management Team should ask the bidder to renew \\ntheir bid proposal in writing. \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 27 of 48 \\nWhat Is Negotiable? \\n \\nPursuant to 801 CMR 21.07(1), the PMT may negotiate with selected bidder(s) prior to execution of a \\ncontract based on what was specified in the RFR.  The Standard Contract Form identifies the following \\nhierarchy or order of precedence of documents:  \\n \\n1. the applicable Commonwealth Terms and Conditions, \\n2. the Standard Contract Form including the Instructions and Contractor Certifications,  \\n3. the Request for Response (RFR) or other solicitation, \\n4. the Contractor’s Response, and additional negotiated terms,  \\n5. provided that additional negotiated terms will take precedence over the relevant terms in the RFR \\nand the Contractor’s Response only if made using the process outlined in  801 CMR 21.07, \\nincorporated herein, provided that any amended RFR or Response terms result in best value, lower \\ncosts, or a more cost effective Contract. \\n \\n801 CMR 21.07 (1(a) and (b) allow additional terms and clarifications to take precedence over the original \\nRFR and Contractor’s Response ONLY if the terms do not change the boilerplate terms of the contracts \\n(specifically or by implication) and are within the scope of the RFR and Contractor’s Response.   \\n \\nThe better value standard described in 801 CMR 21.07(1)(c) allows the Department and a selected bidder, \\nor a Contractor, to negotiate a change in any element of contract performance or cost identified in the RFR \\nor the bidder’s response which results in lower costs, or a more cost-effective or better value commodity \\nor service than was presented in the bidder’s original selected response.  The additional terms will take \\nprecedence over the terms in the RFR or Contractor’s Response provided the terms do not change the \\nboilerplate terms of the contracts (specifically or by implication) and results in a better value than \\nidentified in the RFR and Contractor’s Response. \\n \\nAffirmative Market Program (AMP) Plan Negotiations: Prior to signing a contract, agencies may negotiate \\nthe AMP Plan and benchmark for spending with SOMWBA certified M/WBEs for the duration of the \\ncontract, but only to increase what was committed to in the original response. Please see the Affirmative \\nMarket Program guidance for more information pertaining to AMP plan negotiations. Negotiated changes \\nmust be included in the procurement file. \\n \\nAdditional Negotiated Items Agreed to by Both Parties: Pursuant to 801 CMR 21.07(1)(b), the PMT and a \\nselected bidder, or a Contractor, may negotiate additional language which clarifies their understanding of, \\nbut does not change, the language of the contract or contract performance identified in the original RFR \\nand a bidder’s response. These clarifications may provide a more detailed description of the language in \\nan RFR and the response. They may also provide additional terms and the meaning of terms in the \\napplicable Commonwealth Terms and Conditions and the Standard Contract Form. Clarifications may fill in \\nthe gaps and “spell-out” the understanding of the Department and the Contractor regarding their \\nrespective contract responsibilities. Clarifications may not be used to have the effect of negating, \\nmodifying or replacing language in the applicable Commonwealth Terms and Conditions and the Standard \\nContract Form. The following are examples of acceptable clarifications or additions to a contract, which \\nclarify, but do not change, the intent of the contract language or the rights of the Department: \\n \\nAcceptable Clarifications \\n• \\nFor the purposes of this contract, the term “records” in the contract shall include performance \\nrecords with the dates and times of all service calls, the reasons for the calls and how these \\nwere resolved. \\n• \\nFor the purposes of this contract, “normal wear” shall mean natural forces acting upon \\nequipment while it is operated within product specifications. Normal wear shall not include \\nnegligence, misuse, external forces or the use of commodities or services that are not \\ncompatible with the Contractor’s stated specifications. \\n• \\nThe Contractor and Department agree that “notice” under this contract may be delivered initially \\nby fax but shall not be effective until the date of postmark of First Class Postage Prepaid, \\naddressed to the contract manager of either party at the address listed in the contract. \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 28 of 48 \\nAcceptable Clarifications \\n• \\nThe Contractor agrees, pursuant to negotiations, to supply a newer, more advanced model of \\nthe commodity procured pursuant to this RFR for the same price as the Contractor’s bid price, \\nwhich provides better value to the Commonwealth. \\n \\nThe following selected examples are not acceptable clarifications or additions to a contract since they \\nmaterially change the intent of the contract language and the rights of the Department: \\n \\nUnacceptable Clarifications \\n• \\nFor the purpose of this contract, the term “Contractor” shall not include subcontractors. \\n• \\nThe Contractor shall not be responsible for delays in performance or negligence of a \\nsubcontractor. \\n• \\nPursuant to the certification which states that “The Contractor represents that it is qualified to \\nprovide the performance specified in the contract and possesses or shall obtain all requisite \\nlicenses and permits,” shall be modified by adding at the beginning of this sentence, “To the \\nbest of its knowledge and belief.” \\n• \\nThe section entitled “Indemnification” in the Commonwealth Terms and Conditions shall be \\ndeleted and replaced with the following language, “[any alternative language of bidder...].” \\n• \\nThe Contractor may change the costs in the cost section at any time without prior notice. \\n \\nWhat Is Not Negotiable? A Department may not negotiate the terms or a change to the Standard Contract \\nForm or the applicable Commonwealth Terms and Conditions. Acceptance of any other bidder-submitted \\nstandard form or contract should not be construed as a Department’s approval of any conflicting language \\nthat may be on these documents.  \\n \\nThe Office of the Attorney General has recommended that Departments not sign additional bidder-\\nsubmitted contracts, invoices, or other documents containing contractual terms. Departments that choose \\nto sign these types of documents do so at their own risk and are responsible for any associated costs, \\nlegal representation or damages. \\n \\nIn certain circumstances, however, the PMT may wish to consult with the OSD Legal Bureau regarding \\nsoftware license agreements or other contractual issues. In addition, Departments may not negotiate for \\nany new commodities or services that are outside the scope of the original RFR. \\n \\nSince the applicable Commonwealth Terms and Conditions and the Standard Contract Form are available \\nelectronically, it is important to note that any changes or electronic alterations by either the Department \\nor the Contractor to the official version of these forms, as jointly published by ANF, CTR and OSD, shall be \\nvoid.  Furthermore, Departments are advised to include language in their RFR informing bidders that, by \\nsubmitting a response, they are agreeing to execute these and other Commonwealth standard forms as is \\nand may not raise exceptions or make changes to these forms if awarded a contract. \\n \\nUnsuccessful Negotiations: If the Department is unable to negotiate the programmatic, fiscal or \\nadministrative terms of the contract with the initially selected bidder(s) in a reasonable period of time, \\nthen the Department may disqualify that bidder and begin negotiations with the next qualified bidder. A \\nDepartment may also choose to cancel the procurement and either begin again or pursue any other option \\npermitted under the regulation. \\n \\nPursuant to 801 CMR 21.07(2)(d), a selected bidder’s response may be disqualified if, according to the \\nPMT, the bidder \\n \\n1. Intentionally delays the timely execution of the applicable Commonwealth Terms and Conditions or the \\nStandard Contract Form or is unable to execute timely even for reasonable delays. \\n2. Conditions the execution of the applicable Commonwealth Terms and Conditions or the Standard \\nContract Form upon the procuring Department’s acceptance of additional material or amended contract \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 29 of 48 \\nterms and conditions, or specifies that the bidder’s response is “non-negotiable,” “all-or-nothing” or \\nthat there can be “no substitutions.” \\n3. Negotiates in bad faith. \\n4. Refuses to execute a Commonwealth Terms and Conditions or the Standard Contract Form. \\n5. Demands that the Department execute the bidder’s contract form instead of or in addition to the \\napplicable Commonwealth Terms and Conditions or the Standard Contract Form. \\n6. Is unable to reach final agreement on contractual terms with the Department within a reasonable time \\nas determined by the Department. \\n \\n\\uf03f For POS Only: Other Negotiation Considerations: Department staff who are responsible for negotiating \\nhuman and social service contracts also need to be familiar with and understand the limitations imposed \\non such contracts by statute (including G.L. c. 29, s. 29B; St. 1993, c. 110, s. 274, as amended), \\nregulation (including 808 CMR 1.00) and funding source (legislative language or federal grant language). \\nFor example, reimbursements for commodities and services that are not directly required for the specific \\nclient service are prohibited. \\n \\nDepartment negotiators should also carefully review 808 CMR 1.00, especially sections 1.03 on price and \\nreimbursement limitations and 1.05 on non-reimbursable costs. (See also the associated guidance entitled \\nGeneral Audit and Compliance Requirements available via a link at the end of this document.) While the \\nfailure of a Department to identify contract terms that do not conform to such provisions does not relieve \\nthe Contractor of its obligation to comply, it is obviously better for all if such problems can be avoided. \\n \\nContract Signed/Dated by Authorized Signatories \\n \\nContracts must have live signatures and dates by an authorized signatory of the Department and the \\nContractor.  The date is an inextricable part of a contract signature and cannot be pre-filled, pre-typed or \\nadded by anyone other than the signatory.  The signatory must execute the contract and indicate the date \\ntheir signature was made.  Signatories may not enter dates that are prior (retroactive) to the actual date \\nthe signature was made.  Department head or authorized signatory and authorized signatory of the \\nContractor must sign (wet signature) and date Contract or amendment prior to start of performance, or \\ncontemporaneously with the need for an amendment.  Minor changes or corrections made after execution \\nof a contract or amendment must be initialed by the authorized signatories of both parties, or the \\ndocuments must be re-executed to reflect the corrections.  \\n \\nElectronic signatures can not be used for contracts, amendments or underlying supporting \\ndocumentation requiring a signature.  Electronic signatures are limited to the MMARS \\ntransactions that support contracts and amendments.  This restriction does not apply to RFRs and \\nresponses to RFRS that are submitted electronically through Comm-PASS, provided that contracts, \\namendments and other documents requiring signatures (W-9s etc.) are submitted in hard copy with a wet \\nsignature. \\n \\nDepartment Head Authorized Signatories will be listed as part of a Department’s MMARS security roles.  \\nIndividuals who are assigned “Administrator” security Role with Department Head Signature Authorization \\nmay authorize any MMARS transaction on-line or on behalf of any other staff and may also authorize any \\nunderlying supporting documentation, including executing contracts.   \\n \\nPlease see section above Live Signatures and Dates Required on Contracts.  Please see Policy Chapter on \\n“Department Head Signature Authorization and Electronic Signatures for MMARS transactions” \\nand Policy Chapter on MMARS “Security” for additional information. \\n \\nContractor Authorized Signatory Listing (CASL)  \\n \\nA Contractor Authorized Signatory Listing (CASL) is required for any Contract executed by the \\nDepartment.  This policy applies to all state Departments within the Judiciary, Executive and Legislative \\nBranches.  A Contractor Authorized Signatory Listing (CASL) must be obtained for any contract \\nregardless of value. \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 30 of 48 \\nSubmitting a document to Final status in MMARS will be interpreted as the Department Head’s certification \\nthat the document and all underlying supporting documentation are supported by sufficient authorized \\nfunds and comply with Comptroller policies and procedures and other requirements of law (including \\nprocurement requirements, legislative requirements, etc.). \\n \\nThis certification includes the requirement outlined in this policy that the Department is \\nresponsible for verifying the authority of any contract signatory to sign a contract (both for the \\nDepartment and the Contractor) and the authenticity of the signature on a contract (the \\nsignature was actually made by the authorized signatory and not a designee).  Therefore, a \\nDepartment may not submit any contract related MMARS transaction to Final status unless the \\ncontract signatories have been validated in accordance with this policy. \\n \\nAt a minimum, a list of authorized signatories for a Contractor must be attached to the record copy of \\neach contract or contract amendment filed at the Department.  This CASL may be obtained once per \\nContractor (as part of either the procurement or contract execution process) and photocopied and \\nattached to each contract the Department has with that Contractor until the listing is updated. \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nThe CASL listing DOES NOT have to be attached to: \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAny photocopy of a contract submitted to CTR or OSD for PEND review and processing; or  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAny Commonwealth Terms and Conditions or Commonwealth Terms and Conditions for Health and \\nHuman Services, submitted to CTR for filing. \\n \\nReview of proof of Contractor signature authorization will be made during Quality Assurance and other \\npost-audit reviews.  Departments will be reviewed or audited based upon the policies identified in this \\nPolicy.  \\n \\nPlease see “Contracts – Contractor Authorized Signatory Listing Policy” for additional \\ninformation and Vendor/Customer File and W9s for requirements for Department verification of \\nany VCC or VCM.  \\n \\nDetailed Description of Performance  \\n \\nThe scope of contract performance must be detailed enough to identify the expected performance, the \\nappropriate classification of expenditure (object codes) and the proper state accounting system (MMARS) \\ntransaction type.  (Please see the Expenditure Classification Handbook for object codes and accompanying \\nauthorized transactions and other requirements).  For most contracts, the performance will be outlined in \\na procurement document and a Contractor’s response to the procurement.  For other contracts, these \\ndetails will be negotiated after the contract award as part of the contract scope of performance and \\nbudget.  Contracts which are executed for a multi-year period must reflect terms which are applicable for \\nthe full period of the executed contract.  \\n \\nRequired Approvals \\n \\nThe following approvals may be required for a contract.  Some approvals are required to be obtained prior \\nto the execution of a contract and may affect the contract effective start date.  The purchasing \\nDepartment is responsible for obtaining all necessary approvals for contract execution and for notifying \\nthe Contractor when all approvals are received and funding is available to begin performance. \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nDepartment Head Approval.  Department head or authorized signatory must sign (wet \\nsignature) and date Contracts, amendments or other obligations prior to the start of performance, \\nor contemporaneously with the need for an amendment, payment etc.  Electronic signatures can \\nnot yet be used for contracts, amendments or underlying supporting documentation. A Department \\nmust be authorized to enter into contracts (appropriation to support contract) in order to make \\npayments against contracts and the Department Head or designee must approve itemized \\nexpenditures. See G.L. c. 29, § 19.  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nSecretariat Signoff.  Secretariat signoff is required for consultant contracts (G.L. c. 29, § 29A); \\nhuman and social service contracts (G.L. c. 29, § 29B) prior to the effective start date of contract; \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 31 of 48 \\nCTR and OSD will not verify secretariat signoff as part of prior review, but will verify signoff as part \\nof quality assurance reviews.  There is no standard format for secretariat signoff.  The Department \\ncan obtain secretariat signoff of the RFR or the contract, provided the signoff is obtained prior to \\nthe effective start date of the contract and the format for obtaining the secretariat signoff is \\nreliable and verifiable.  Processing a contract MMARS transaction to Final status will act as a \\ncertification to the Comptroller that secretariat signoff has been obtained.  Compliance with this \\nrequirement shall be subject to audit.  Please see section on Secretariat Signature Authorization \\nabove.   \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAttorney General Approval Legal Services Contracts (all Departments).  All Commonwealth \\nDepartments are required to obtain prior written review by the Office of the Attorney General \\n(AGO) for any legal services performed for the Department under a contract.  The AGO review of \\nlegal services contracts is limited to determining that any attorney/firm hired by a Department is a \\nmember of the Massachusetts Bar (or out of state bar) in good standing, has no apparent conflicts \\nof interests, and if providing litigation services, will appear in court on behalf of the Commonwealth \\nonly after his/her appointment as a Special Assistant Attorney General (SAAG) by the AGO.  The \\nAttorney General Review Form for Attorneys Providing Legal Services form must be completed and \\nmailed (with required attachments) to the AGO for any new legal services contract, and for any \\nsignificant amendment to the scope of services under an existing contract, PRIOR to the start of \\nperformance or change in performance.  Please see: Attorney General Policy for Prior Review of \\nAttorneys.  The form must include: \\no \\nAn attached detailed Scope of Services outlining the specific legal services (H09 and N03 \\nobject codes) that will be performed by the attorney or firm.  AGO PRIOR to beginning any \\nservices.  \\no \\nA copy/printout of the Board of Bar Overseers record of good standing for each attorney \\nlisted who will be assigned to perform services, or who are identified as “key personnel” \\nunder the Contract.  Link to the following Internet site:  \\nhttp://db.state.ma.us/obcbbo/bboreg/lookup.asp.  Locate each attorney assigned to \\nperform contract services and print out the “Attorney Status Report” for each attorney.  \\nSimilar documentation of licensure and good standing must be provided for any out-of-state \\nattorney.  Departments must annually verify that any attorney(s) assigned to the contract \\nremains in good standing for the duration of the contract.  \\no \\nExecutive Departments must attach a Consultant Contractor Mandatory Submission Form \\ncompleted by the Contractor with all required attachments.  (Pursuant to G.L. c. 29, s. 29A \\nand G.L. c. 7A, s. 6); Non-Executive Departments must attach a statement of financial \\ninterest from the attorney(s) pursuant to G.L. c. 7A, s. 6 and may use the Consultant \\nContractor Mandatory Submission Form or other appropriate format.) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nOffice of the Chief Counsel to the Governor signoff of all legal services.  The Office of the \\nChief Counsel to the Governor requires signoff of all legal services contracts (H09, N03) prior to \\nprocuring the services or executing a contract (Level III –Executive only) (See G.L. c. 30, § 65 and \\n801 CMR 21.00).   \\n\\uf0a7 \\nOversight Department Secondary Review.  CTR, OSD and other oversight Department may \\nrequire secondary review for contracts exceeding the MMARS transaction processing delegation \\nthreshold.  MMARS transactions are targeted for workflow to the relevant oversight Department to \\ncomplete the review in order to process the document.  OSD reviews MMARS transactions for \\nCommodities and Services for non-statewide contracts which exceed a Department’s delegation \\nthreshold.  Please see OSD’s Procurement Information Center (PIC) for more detailed \\ninformation related to commodities and services secondary review.  CTR reviews services \\ncontracts, grants, subsidies, construction contracts which exceed a Department’s delegation \\nthreshold, and all ISAs.  OSD’s and CTR’s secondary review is not a legal review and signoff will not \\nbe interpreted to mean that the underlying document, supporting documentation and process are \\nlegal.  The Department Head makes this certification when the document is submitted to Final \\nstatus and sent to workflow.  Oversight Departments conduct quality assurance and administrative \\nreviews of the paperwork and document to ensure basic compliance state finance law and other \\napplicable requirements. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nPayroll Approval Relative to personnel.  Sometimes all or a portion of the payroll of a state \\nemployee may be funded from a contract (usually an InterDepartmental Service Agreement (ISA).  \\nThe Comptroller requires a certification from each spending authority on the bi-weekly payroll \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 32 of 48 \\nconfirming the hours worked by employees and that the payments are in compliance with state \\nfinance law.  This certification includes a certification required under G.L. c. 29, § 31 from each \\nspending authority that each employee receiving a salary under the warrant is being paid for \\n“duties performed directly for the employing agency and not for duties performed for another state \\nagency”.  Therefore, employee from one Department may not perform the duties of another \\nDepartment absent specific legislative authorization.  Departments need to ensure that contracts \\nand payroll are approved in accordance with these requirements.  Please see InterDepartmental \\nService Agreements (ISAs) for additional information on the use of ISAs to fund payroll costs for \\nstate employees.   \\n \\nContract Effective Start Date and Termination Date \\n \\nPursuant to 801 CMR 21.00, 815 CMR 2.00, 815 CMR 6.00, and this CTR policy, the contract effective \\nstart date for all contracts using the Commonwealth Terms and Conditions and Standard Contract Form, \\nor the InterDepartmental Service Agreement Form will be interpreted to be the latest date the contract is \\nsigned and otherwise approved by the parties, or a later date specified in the contract.  Notwithstanding \\nany verbal or written representations the legal effective start date of a contract shall be determined by the \\nlatest dates the contracts were executed: \\n\\uf0a7 \\nby an authorized signatory of the Contractor (verified through Contractor Authorized Signatory \\nListing which must be attached to the contract) and  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nby an authorized signatory of the Department (verified through checking Department Head \\nSignature Authorization/Security plan filed as part of the Department’s Internal controls),  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nthe date the contract received Secretariat or other approvals required by law or regulation, if \\napplicable, including:  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nSecretariat signoff required for consultant contracts (G.L. c. 29, § 29A); human and social service \\ncontracts (G.L. c. 29, § 29B) prior to the effective date of contract.  (CTR and OSD will not verify \\nsecretariat signoff as part of prior review, but will verify signoff as part of quality assurance \\nreviews.) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAGO approval for attorneys as Special Assistant Attorneys General (SAAGs) for attorneys \\nrepresenting Departments in court (litigation services) unless attorney already approved as SAAG.  \\nApplies to all Departments (Levels I-III) and must be obtained prior to start of performance. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nOffice of the Chief Counsel to the Governor signoff of all legal services contracts (H09, N03) prior \\nto submitting to Final status in MMARS (Level III –Executive only) (See G.L. c. 30, § 65). \\nAnd,  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nany LATER date for performance to begin listed in the contract.   \\n \\nA contract (including a grant, subsidy or ISA) will terminate on the date listed as the termination date in \\nthe contract unless the contract is properly amended prior to that date or unless terminated earlier in \\naccordance with the terms of the contract. \\n \\nPursuant to G.L. c. 29, § 26, § 27 and § 29, obligations may not be incurred unless there are sufficient \\nappropriated or non-appropriated funds available to support the obligations.  Therefore, contract \\nexecution which occurs prior to the beginning of the fiscal year in which funds are to be appropriated will \\nnot authorize obligations to be incurred prior to the appropriation of funds (Interim budget or GAA). \\n \\nEffective Start and Termination Dates in Contract Must Match Encumbrance and Payments \\n \\nPrior to submitting a MMARS contract encumbrance document to Final status the Department \\nAdministrator processing the document is responsible for ensuring that the dates, amounts and other key \\ninformation in MMARS match the information that appears on the contract documents including verifying \\nthe contract effective start date and termination dates based upon the signature and approval dates.  \\nSubmission of the document to Final status acts as the Department Head’s certification that MMARS \\nreflects the legal effective start date based upon the signature and approval dates appearing in the \\ncontract. \\n \\nThe effective start date and the contract termination date listed in the Contract must match the dates on \\nthe encumbrance and payment documents (transaction) in the state accounting system (MMARS).  The \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 33 of 48 \\nonly exception to this general rule involves certain statewide contracts or MSAs for leases or maintenance \\ncontracts which may have contracts that begin during the start and termination dates of the Statewide \\nContract or MSA but may have payment obligations which extend beyond the termination date of the \\nprocurement and underlying Statewide contract or MSA.  Departments will be audited based upon the \\naccuracy of MMARS entries in relation to supporting contract documentation. \\n \\nInterdepartmental Service Agreements (ISAs) require that ISA performance may not begin until the ISA is \\nexecuted AND funding is available for expenditure in the Seller Department’s Child account.  See \\nInterdepartmental Service Agreements (ISAs) and the Interdepartmental Service Agreement (ISA) \\nForm. \\n \\nChecking Debarment Status of Contractor  \\n \\nContractors signing the Standard Contract Form certify that neither the Contractor nor any of its \\nsubcontractors are currently debarred or suspended by the federal or state government under any law or \\nregulation including, Executive Order 147; G.L. c. 29, s. 29F G.L. c.30, § 39R, G.L. c.149, § 27C, G.L. \\nc.149, § 44C,   G.L. c.149, § 148B and G.L. c. 152, s. 25C.  \\n \\nAll departments must check the debarred vendor lists below before awarding or renewing a \\ncontract in order to ensure that they are not awarding a contract to a debarred vendor.  \\nNo Department shall knowingly accept a response or award a contract to any Contractor, or approve a \\nsubcontract to any party which is currently subject to any state or federal debarment order or \\ndetermination, including, but not limited to, M.G.L. c.29, § 29F, M.G.L. c.30, § 39R, M.G.L. c.149, § 27C, \\nM.G.L. c.149, § 44C,   M.G.L. c.149, § 148B and M.G.L. c.152, § 25C.  Pursuant to 801 CMR 21.06 (10), a \\n“Procuring Department shall disqualify any response that the Department determines to be unresponsive, \\nincluding, but not limited to: … (d) Responses submitted by a Bidder, or which identify a subcontractor, \\ncurrently subject to any State or federal debarment order or determination.” \\nThe following websites contain lists, which are updated periodically, of businesses, which have been \\ndebarred: \\n• \\nFederal Government’s Excluded Parties List System  \\n• \\nDivision of Capital Asset Management Debarred Contractor’s List  \\n• \\nBusinesses Issued Stop Work Orders by the Department of Industrial Accidents  \\n• \\nOffice of the Attorney General Debarment List  \\n• \\nContractors Suspended or Debarred by MassDOT \\nSee Vendor Debarment. If you have questions about debarment, you may contact OSD\\'s Legal Bureau \\nvia email.   \\n \\nThe Federal General Services Administration (GSA) has posted the Federal Government’s List of Parties \\nExcluded from Federal Procurement and Non-procurement Programs on the World Wide Web. OMB \\nCircular A-87 Attachment A and U.S. Executive Order 12459 state that a contract should not be made with \\nany party that has been debarred or suspended. Noncompliance could result in a reduction or termination \\nof federal funds to a state Department that provides federally-funded programs. The GSA prepared list \\nincludes contractors that are excluded from Federal procurement. Similarly, M.G L. c. 29, § 29F requires \\nthe Secretary of Administration to establish and maintain a consolidated list of contractors to whom public \\ncontracts shall not be awarded and from whom offers, bids, or proposals shall not be solicited.  The \\nstatute mandates that any Contractor debarred or suspended on these lists cannot participate in State \\ncontracts.  \\n \\nCurrently, ANF supports the use of the GSA list as the ANF listing required under the statute.  All \\nDepartments should consult the federal GSA list before moving forward with any procurement related \\ndecisions.   \\n\\uf0a7 \\nThe address of the GSA site is: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100000. \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 34 of 48 \\n\\uf0a7 \\n For ease of access you can also access the Federal General Services Administration (GSA) list from \\nthe Operational Services Division Home Page or the Massachusetts’ Procurement Access & \\nSolicitation System (Comm-PASS) Home Page.

Further guidance on \\nprocurement can be found in the OSD Procurement Information Center (PIC). \\n \\nContract Funding Requirements - Obligations May Not Exceed Appropriation  \\n \\nPursuant to G.L. c. 29 § 26, § 27 and § 29, Departments are required to expend funds only for the \\npurposes set forth by the Legislature and within the funding limits established through appropriation, \\nallotment and subsidiary.  Departments may not incur a liability for the Commonwealth in excess of their \\nappropriation or allotment.  This means that a Department cannot authorize performance to begin under a \\ncontract (including a grant, ISA, chargeback, lease, rental or TELP), request or accept commodities or \\nservices (including personnel) in excess of an existing appropriation and allotment, or sufficient non-\\nappropriated available funds. \\n \\nAvailable funding means funds that have been appropriated and allotted, or otherwise available which can \\nbe encumbered and expended (including federal funds that have been authorized and are available for \\ndraw down, or trust funds with sufficient cash).  Funding identified in a filed but not yet enacted \\nappropriation act, supplemental budget or other legislative act shall not qualify as available funding and \\nwill not be sufficient authorization for continued performance or new performance.  Authorization by \\nHouse and Senate Ways and Means Committees, the Governor’s Office, Executive Office for Administration \\nand Finance or any other oversight agency shall not be sufficient authorization for continued performance \\nor new performance since this authorization is not legislative authorization for expending appropriated \\nfunds Please also see “Commonwealth Bill Payment Policy” for additional requirements.. \\n \\nInsufficient Appropriations for Required Expenditures, Expiring Accounts \\n \\nAppropriations and allotments must be spent in accordance with prescribed subsidiary schedules.  G.L. c. \\n29, § 27;  G.L. c. 29, § 26.  Departments must do everything legally allowed to manage within their \\nappropriation.  Departments must immediately notify ANF and House and Senate Ways and Means \\nCommittees of the estimated amount of anticipated deficiency in any appropriation. G.L. c. 29, § 9E.  In \\naddition, to support the series of reliances and delegation, Departments must also notify CTR. \\n \\nIf funding is not available for encumbrance and expenditure, a Department may not authorize \\nperformance to begin or continue, and any performance must halt, personnel reassigned or suspended, or \\nother business adjustments made so that no obligations will be incurred in excess of current available \\nfunding. \\n \\nIf accounts are not reauthorized past the termination date (such as on June 30th for operating accounts, or \\nat the end of a capital bond authorization), or for federal grant awards that have not been made (even if \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 35 of 48 \\nrecurring), Departments may not continue to incur obligations or continue to accept services from \\nemployees or contractors in these accounts.  Contracts must be terminated or suspended, personnel \\nmust be terminated, or contracts and personnel transferred to another appropriate account \\nlegislatively authorized to fund these types of obligations and expenditures. \\n \\nPursuant to G.L. c. 149, § 148, employees must be paid for performance within 5 days of the close of the \\npay period in which they have performed services.  Therefore, it is a serious legal violation, subject to \\nsevere penalties, to request or allow any employee to work without available funding to pay for the \\nperformance within the required payment period.  Therefore, when budget cuts or shortfalls are \\nanticipated, Departments may not request or allow employees to work unless funding will be available to \\npay the employees for the work performed.  Layoff notices must be done with sufficient lead time (45 \\ndays or longer in some cases) to ensure that performance is suspended prior to funding run outs. \\n \\nExpenditures may not be made against other accounts to “front” funds during this time period and such \\nexpenditures may not be retroactively transferred (Expenditure Correction - EX) to these accounts should \\nthe accounts be re-authorized or a new account(s) established.  The Comptroller may not make journal \\nentry (expenditure correction) between accounts if the account ultimately to be charged had insufficient \\nfunds at the time the amount was expended from the other account, unless prior notice is sent to HOU \\nand SEN Ways and Means. (See G.L. c. 7A, § 3).  \\n \\n“The Comptroller shall refuse to permit a disbursement or incurring of an obligation if funds, or \\nallotments of funds, under an appropriation account or subsidiary account under an appropriation \\naccount, sufficient to cover such disbursement or obligation are not available and shall immediately \\ngive notice of such refusal to the Department, office, commission, or institution proposing the \\nexpenditure”  See G.L. c. 29, § 29. \\n \\nThis means that expenditures made to another current account because a supplemental budget has not \\nyet passed, or ISA funding has not been set up, cannot later be charged to the new accounts or \\nreauthorized accounts when the supplemental budget passes, without prior written notice to the House \\nand Senate Committees on Ways and Means (unless the supplemental budget account is authorized with \\nan effective date prior to the date of the expenditures) \\n \\nIf delays are anticipated for any source of funding (including delays in bond funds or the re-award of \\nfederal grant funds) the Chief Fiscal Officer has an obligation to immediately notify CTR of the anticipated \\ndelay, as well as their budget analysts at ANF (if applicable) to seek guidance.    \\n \\n Please also see “Commonwealth Bill Payment Policy” for additional requirements. \\n \\nObligation Authorization Limited by Fiscal Year - Interim Budgets and Accounts Payable. \\n \\nGAA appropriations shall be for ordinary maintenance for the fiscal year unless otherwise authorized.  \\nAppropriations are authorized for commodities, services and other obligations incurred, received and \\naccepted in the current fiscal year and may not be used to pay for future fiscal year obligations (advance \\npayments) nor for prior fiscal year obligations.  See G.L. c.29, § 12.  This means commodities and \\nservices to be paid for with current fiscal year appropriations must be received within the fiscal year (July \\n1-June 30) (see G.L. c. 4, § 7, Ninth). \\n \\nLawful obligations that do not exceed Department’s 1/12th allotment (made quarterly) may be made \\nbetween July 1 and passage of GAA if there is an interim budget.  No commodities or services may be \\naccepted for the new fiscal year and no funds may be expended without an Interim Budget or GAA.  See \\nG.L. c. 29, § 12A.  \\n \\nCTR and ANF will submit an Interim Budget request in the event that the GAA is not passed by the \\nLegislature and signed by the Governor by July 1st. This will provide funding for the continuation of \\nessential services across the Commonwealth. While no new programs or projects are supported as part of \\nthe interim budget, all routine business to carry out Department missions is included (i.e., payrolls, client \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 36 of 48 \\nbenefits, leases, commodities and services).  Once you are notified that the Interim Budget is signed, \\nDepartments should proceed with routine business, including paying bills in 30 days.  Departments are \\nresponsible to expend only funds from accounts that are in both the House and Senate Budgets. If there is \\na question about whether an account will be funded, the CFO should confer with ANF. \\n \\nThe accounts payable period to pay encumbrances for fiscal year ending on June 30th runs from July 1st \\nthrough August 31st.  The Fiscal Affairs Division (FAD) may extend the accounts payable period to pay \\nencumbrances until September 15th subject to special request from Department.  State finance law \\nrequires that remaining balances revert to the General Fund on or before September 15th.  G.L. c.29, § \\n13. \\n \\nPlease also see “Commonwealth Bill Payment Policy” for additional requirements. \\n \\nContract Compensation Must be Identified and Reserved \\n \\nDepartments are responsible for identifying funding availability (appropriation and allotments) prior to \\nincurring any obligation (including allowing personnel to work) or executing a contract.  Each contract \\nmust have a maximum obligation or specified rates for the full period of the contract.  The full value of the \\ncontract (maximum obligation) or the full value of “anticipated expenditures” must be reserved (pre-\\nencumbered or encumbered) for the full period of the contract in the MMARS state accounting system \\nupon execution of a contract and contemporaneously with the start of performance, to enable payments to \\nbe processed timely (within 30 days of the first invoice, or earlier if specified in the Contract or if prompt \\npayment vendor discounts are available), or to establish the accounts necessary to support an ISA.  \\n(Please see “Accounts Payable – Bill Paying Policy” for bill payment requirements.  Please see Policy  \\n“Contracts – Interdepartmental Service Agreements (ISAs)” for the funding requirements for ISAs.) \\n \\nHigher Education Departments may have contracts that are funded with appropriated state funds on \\nMMARS and non-appropriated trust funds that are outside MMARS.  If a contract is funded from both \\nMMARS and non-MMARS funds there must be supporting documentation (a detailed budget showing the \\namounts funded through MMARS and through the university) as a part of the contract.  The contract must \\nidentify the MMARS and non-MMARS related portion so that the total maximum obligation matches the \\ncontract.   \\n \\nContract Encumbrances Considered “Commodity-Based Encumbrances” \\n \\nUnder MMARS the term “commodity” applies to both commodities and services.  Commodities include but \\nare not limited to any articles of trade, items, products, supplies, information technology resources, \\nautomated data processing and telecommunication hardware, software and systems.  Services include but \\nare no limited to furnishing of time, labor, effort, specialized skills by a Contractor including operational, \\nprofessional, maintenance, consultant, maintenance and repair, non-professional and human and social \\nservices.   \\n \\nThe contract related MMARS transactions are considered “Commodity-based” documents and are the only \\nMMARS transactions with a “commodity” line.  These documents require a commodity code.   \\nNon-Commodity Based Encumbrances  \\n \\nNon-commodity based encumbrances reserves funds for postage, subscriptions and memberships, \\nadvertising expenses, fees, fines, licenses, and permits, confidential investigation expenses, donations, \\nexhibits/displays, electricity, sewage disposal, water, natural gas, incidental purchases and other \\nexpenditures that do not require a procurement and contract.   \\n \\nDepartments should refer to the Expenditure Classification Handbook for details on which \\nencumbrances are available for selected object codes.  For additional guidance related to MMARS \\ntransactions see Job Aids for Procurement/Contracts and Policy Chapters under “Accounts Payable” for \\npayments. \\n \\nContract Filing \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 37 of 48 \\n \\nAll Departments are required to file complete original or certified copies of contracts as directed by the \\nComptroller prior to payment.  G.L. c. 7A, § 5.  Pursuant to 815 CMR 10.00 each Department shall be the \\nrecord keeper of the original copy (“record copy”) of all contracts and supporting documentation.  The \\nrecord copy shall be filed at the Department.  Copies of a contract may have to be submitted to CTR or \\nOSD for prior review and processing if the total value of the contract exceeds the MMARS transaction \\nprocessing (transaction) delegation limit for the Department.  \\n \\nThe Comptroller requires that all contracts are encumbered and filed promptly upon execution to ensure \\ntimely payment for all performance in accordance with state finance law and the Commonwealth Bill \\nPaying Policy.  Please see “Accounts Payable – Commonwealth Bill Paying Policy”. \\n \\nProper IRS/Contractor Registration (Vendor/Customer File) \\n \\nA Contractor or other payee must be registered with the proper IRS form (Form W-9-Massachusetts \\nSubstitute W-9 Form,  or W-8 – Foreign Payees) in the state accounting system.  Please see Policy \\nChapter “Accounts Payable – Vendor Management and W-9s”.   \\n \\nSubmitting a document to Final status in MMARS will be interpreted as the Department Head’s certification \\nthat the document and all underlying supporting documentation are supported by sufficient authorized \\nfunds and comply with Comptroller policies and procedures and other requirements of law (including \\nprocurement requirements, legislative requirements, etc.). \\n \\nThis certification includes the requirement outlined in this policy that the Department is \\nresponsible for verifying the authority of any contract signatory to sign a contract (both for the \\nDepartment and the Contractor) and the authenticity of the signature on a contract (the \\nsignature was actually made by the authorized signatory and not a designee).  Therefore, a \\nDepartment may not submit any contract related MMARS transaction to Final status unless the \\ncontract signatories have been validated in accordance with this policy. \\n \\nThe Accounts Payable Bureau of CTR is considered the official Commonwealth Clearinghouse for all \\nmatters related to Federal Income Tax reporting to the IRS and State Income Tax reporting to the \\nDepartment of Revenue (DOR).  This involves the filing of tax reporting forms as an employer (W-2, \\n1099s etc.) and upkeep of the Internal Revenue Services’ and DOR’s rules and regulations for compliance.  \\nThe Accounts Payable Bureau provides technical guidance to Departments regarding their responsibilities \\npertaining to issuing and filing tax reporting information which is not captured at the detail level in MMARS \\nand/or statewide automated payroll systems (HR/CMS and e*mpac).  Please see Vendor/Customer \\nFile and W9s Policy for Department requirements to verify authority and validate all vendor \\ninformation.  \\n \\nVendorWeb \\n \\nDepartments are encouraged to instruct Vendors to use VendorWeb at \\nhttps://massfinance.state.ma.us/VendorWeb/vendor.asp  to track contract payments (with the exception \\nof interdepartmental payments).  Vendors can see their scheduled payments and payment history by \\nlogging on VendorWeb.  On-line you find the tentative scheduled payment date or the actual payment \\ndate, payment number, vendor invoice number, contract number, line amount, any associated text \\ninformation and the Department making the payment.   \\n \\nThe VendorWeb application was created to help the Commonwealth’s vendors get their payment \\nremittance information free and easily.  Vendors access VendorWeb with their Commonwealth Vendor \\nCode.  Vendors can view or download information for payments made and payments scheduled in old and \\nnew MMARS to be paid.  Payment information can be generated using date ranges and can be sorted by a \\nselected Department or by payment from all Departments.   \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 38 of 48 \\nDepartments within the Magnet firewall can also access the CTR Intranet for state employees through the \\nmain CTR website (www.mass.gov/osc)  under “Vendor lookup” to verify payments without having to log \\nin to MMARS.   \\n \\nPayments Require Current Appropriation, CTR Certification and Approved Warrant \\n \\nNo payments shall be made without current appropriation, Department Head approval, Comptroller \\ncertification and approved Governor’s warrant. G.L. c. 29, § 18.  MMARS has been established with \\ninternal controls which prohibit payments from being made unless there are sufficient funds appropriated, \\nallotted and encumbered to support the payments. See G.L. c. 29, § 20.   \\n \\nIn addition, the Comptroller will not certify payment until a Department Head or designee approves the \\nexpenditures.  Submitting a document to Final status in MMARS will be interpreted as the Department \\nHead’s certification that the document and all underlying supporting documentation are supported by \\nsufficient authorized funds and comply with Comptroller policies and procedures and other requirements of \\nlaw (including procurement requirements, legislative requirements, etc.).   \\n \\nOnce Comptroller certification occurs systemically, the successful processing of payment is entered on the \\nwarrant and processed in accordance with the warrant approval process. \\n \\nBill Paying Policy – Payments  \\n \\nThe Comptroller is required to establish a vendor payment schedule.  G.L. c. 7A, § 5.  Departments are \\nrequired to make payments in accordance with the terms of any contract and the Commonwealth’s Bill \\nPayment policy.  For details on payments see Non-Tax Revenue Policies, including the \\nCommonwealth Bill Paying Policy, which includes guidance on standard payment policies, intercept, \\nprompt pay discounts, late penalty interest, retainage, prohibition of pre-payments, payment for result-\\nbased performance, payment for obligations incurred, payment limited to current fiscal year obligations, \\nrecurring and ready payments, contingent fee payments, overpayments and contract back outs.  \\n \\nPrompt Payment Discounts (PPD)  \\n \\nDepartments are required to have Contractors complete the PPD section of the Standard \\nContract Form or identify a legitimate hardship.   \\n \\nDepartments may NOT negotiate accelerated payments in less than the standard \\npayment cycle of 45 days and Payees are NOT entitled to accelerated payments UNLESS \\na prompt payment discount (PPD) is provided to support the Commonwealth’s loss of \\ninvestment earnings for this earlier payment, or unless a payment is legally mandated \\nto be made in less than 45 days (e.g., construction contracts, Ready Payments under \\nG.L. c. 29, s. 23A). \\n \\n• \\nRequiring a PPD to be identified as part of a procurement or contract does not mean that an automatic \\ndiscount will be taken or that the Contractor is required to make a price reduction.  The discount on \\nthe total payment will apply ONLY if the Contractor requests “accelerated” payments in LESS than the \\nstandard payment cycle (currently 45 days).   \\n• \\nContractors that do not want to offer a PPD agree that all payments will be made in the normal course \\nof business using the standard payment cycle and may not later request an accelerated payment \\nunless a PPD is offered.   \\nExceptions for PPD \\n \\nAll Commonwealth contract payments will be processed in the standard payment cycle of 45 days from the \\ndate of an invoice receipt unless there is another legally mandated payment cycle such as: \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 39 of 48 \\n• \\nG.L. c. 30, § 39G – payments on horizontal construction and maintenance projects (roads, bridges, \\netc.), within 30 days.  \\n• \\nG.L. c. 30, § 39K – payments on vertical construction and maintenance projects (buildings), within 30 \\ndays for periodic payments.  \\n• \\nG.L. c. 79, § 37  - payments under certain conditions on Eminent Domain within 30 days.  \\n• \\nCertain credit card payments that require payment within 21-25 calendar days. \\n• \\nReady Payments for human and social services under G.L. c. 29, s. 23A.  \\n• \\nOther statutory or regulatory payment cycles of less than 45 days. \\n \\nFederal and state grant awards are not exempted from the PPD policy will be paid under the standard \\npayment cycle.  Delay in getting contracts executed, financial hardship, or demands for prompt payments \\nare not sufficient legal reasons for automatically accelerating ALL payments under a Contract.  The first \\ngrant or contract installment or payment may be accelerated for the first invoice or initial grant \\ninstallment, but subsequent periodic installments or invoice payments must be scheduled to support the \\nPayee cash flow needs and the standard 45 day EFT payment cycle in accordance with the \\nCommonwealth’s Bill Payment Policy unless a PPD is provided or an earlier payment date is legally \\nmandated. \\n \\nNOTE:  For any contract with an annual single payment, the standard payment cycle must be used unless \\na PPD is provided and this payment may NOT be scheduled to be accelerated in less than the standard \\npayment cycle.   \\n \\nAny accelerated payment that does not provide for a PPD must have a legal justification in Contract file for \\naudit purposes justifying the requirement for an accelerated payment and why the standard payment \\ncycle could not be followed for all payments.  .   \\n \\nEven if a Department has not included the Prompt Payment Discount (PPD) as part of \\nthe RFR process, or for contracts when a procurement is not required, the Department \\nshould require a Contractor to complete Prompt Payment Discounts during the \\ncontract execution, renewal or amendment process to ensure that Prompt Payment \\nDiscounts are available to both the Contractor and the Department to the maximum \\nextent possible. \\n \\nSee also the “Prompt Payment Discounts Policy” for additional details on including this cost savings \\nmechanism in contracts.  \\n \\nAssignment of Payments \\n \\nPursuant to G.L. c. 106, § 9-318, a Contractor may freely assign payments under a contract to a third \\nparty.  The third party receiving payment is called an assignee.  An assignee is not considered a \\n“Contractor” and may not have a separate vendor code established for an assigned payment.  All contract \\npayments are due and owing to the Contractor and the assignee has no legal right to make any claims to \\nthe Department under the contract.  The assignment of payments merely re-directs payments that have \\nbeen lawfully earned and paid to the Contractor to another address.  All reports of payments and tax \\nreporting are recorded for the Contractor.   \\n \\nThe Department has an obligation to verify that the request for the assignment of payments is legitimate \\nand requested directly by the vendor and not the third party.  Absent a court order (verified by the Office \\nof the Attorney General), a Department has no obligation to honor any demands for assignments \\nmade by a third party, even if the third party produces an assignment agreement signed by the \\nvendor.  The Department must still obtain confirmation from the Contractor that the assignment is \\nallowable and a W-9 with the new remittance address is submitted. \\n \\nA Department MAY NOT establish a new vendor code or obtain a W-9 form or a Commonwealth \\nTerms and Conditions from the assignee.  \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 40 of 48 \\n1. The Department must receive documentation from an authorized signatory of the Contractor that \\nthe Contractor agrees to assign payments to a third party assigned under a particular contract(s). \\n \\n2. The Department then submits to the Accounts Payable Bureau a Vendor/Customer Modification \\nForm (VCM) for the Contractor with a FORM W-9 (MASSACHUSETTS SUBSTITUTE W-9 FORM) to \\nadd an additional “payment address” (remittance address) with  “Attn.” or “c/o” or “payable to:” \\nand the assignee’s name and payment address. \\n \\n3. The Contractor’s Legal Name, TIN and Legal Address MAY NOT be changed.  The \\nDepartment must also submit EFT (Electronic Fund Transfer) documentation (required for all \\npayees unless a one-time payment or a hardship accepting EFT) as applicable to enable payments \\nto the assignee electronically. \\n \\n4. Payments are then made using the vendor code with this additional payment address.  A \\nDepartment MAY NOT change the Contractor’s legal address to the address of the third party since \\nthe legal address is necessary for tax reporting purposes and the third party assignee should not \\nget the Contractor’s tax forms.   \\n \\nThe assignment of payments will be made on a contract-by-contract, and Department-by-Department \\nbasis and will not be made on a statewide basis for all payments due a Contractor (unless approved by \\nboth OSD and CTR for a Statewide Contract).  In the event a payment is inadvertently issued to the \\nContractor, the Department will have no obligation to “chase” the payment.  The Contractor will be legally \\nobligated to forward that payment to the assignee.  The assignee has no rights against the Department \\nunder any assignment agreement or under any contract. \\n \\nPlease see “Commonwealth Bill Payment Policy” for additional requirements and  \\nVendor/Customer File and W9s for requirements for Department verification of any VCC or \\nVCM.   \\n \\nComm-PASS Posting Requirements (if the Request for Response was Posted on Comm-PASS \\n \\nIn addition to executing the Standard Contract Form, certain Comm-PASS posting requirements \\nassociated with the contract are mandatory for RFRs posted on Comm-PASS. Specifically, Departments \\nmust \"post the contract\" on Comm-PASS. The Comm-PASS system, through its contract \"wizard,\" guides \\nthe Department through the entries of contract award date, additional team members, if any, contract \\ndocuments (the upload of these documents, other than the Standard Contract Form), vendors, vendor \\ndocuments (such as price lists), vendor SOMBWA certification and EPP participation and contract updates. \\n \\nDepartments are required to either post the contract or update the solicitation within 60 days of the close \\ndate of the solicitation even if a contract has not yet been awarded. Please see the associated guidance \\nentitled Comm-PASS Policies in the Procurement Information Center (PIC). \\n \\nNote: Comm-PASS does not automatically transform a Solicitation into a Contract. To complete the \\nsolicitation portion of the procurement process on Comm-PASS, Department users are required to perform \\nan Update, which requires the selection of a status: Closed-Pending Evaluation, Closed-Pending Award, \\nClosed-Contract Awarded, or Closed-Cancelled.  \\n \\nOnce the Solicitation reaches a Closed-Contract Awarded status, the Department user must use the \\nContract functionality to create a separate Contract record. \\n \\nContract Management \\n \\nThe purpose of contract management is to ensure that Departments are satisfied with Contractor \\nperformance and that the Contractor is in full compliance with all of the terms and conditions of the \\ncontract.  Additionally, contract management supports the Contractor to ensure that Departments make \\npayments in accordance with payment terms, are familiar with procurement processes of the \\nCommonwealth and the automated systems that support the procurement and payment process, i.e., \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 41 of 48 \\nMMARS, Ready Payment, Recurring Payment, EFT and Comm-PASS.  Contract management is customer \\nservice.  Its primary role is to assist and/or resolve any and all issues, concerns and problems that may \\narise from customers and contractors as it relates to contracts administered by the Commonwealth. \\n \\nContract Managers \\nA contract manager is assigned responsibility for the oversight and management of the activity within a \\ncontract, including compliance with state finance law and applicable laws, regulations, policies and \\nprocedures.  Part of effective internal controls, fiscal responsibility and effective and efficient expenditure \\nof Commonwealth funds is dependent upon careful oversight and management of a contract by the \\nContract manager.  Contract managers who are listed on the Standard Contract Form are considered \\nauthorized representatives who can manage the contract on behalf of the Department.  Among other \\ntasks, a contract manager may: \\n \\n\\uf0a7 \\nProvide document processing and technical assistance to contractors and customers; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nConduct market research and analysis to determine the strengths and/or weaknesses of the \\nmarketplace which will assist in determining the effectiveness of the contract and whether or not \\nthe terms, conditions and costs are competitive in the current environment; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nGenerate usage reports to determine dollar volume and what services or products are being utilized \\nand measure this information against projections; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nMeasure Contractor performance against established performance criteria to ensure compliance \\nwith the terms and conditions set forth in the contract; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nConfer with customers, contractors and potential bidders in order to exchange information and \\nkeep up to date with current needs and current products being offered by the industry; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nCoordinate and attend exhibitions and conferences to become familiar with new commodities and \\nservices for Department use; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nInitiate contract negotiations and determine whether contracts should be renewed; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nConfer with legal staff to determine corrective action, when necessary, to bring a Contractor back \\ninto compliance with a contract; and  \\n\\uf0a7 \\nConduct user surveys to determine the effectiveness of existing contracts and the potential for new \\ncontracts. \\n \\nDepartments are encouraged to communicate regularly with Contract Managers, especially when new \\npolicies are distributed to the Department’s key state finance law officers, and ensure that staff are \\nappropriately trained and have access to the tools necessary to ensure state finance law compliance.   \\n \\nMonitoring And Evaluating Contractor Performance And Compliance \\nThe Commonwealth has a responsibility to conduct monitoring and evaluation of the commodities and \\nservices it purchases. These activities can assist in identifying and reducing fiscal and programmatic risk \\nas early as possible, thus protecting both public funds and clients being served. In addition, federal \\nmonitoring requirements must be observed if federal funds are used to purchase services. \\n \\nContract managers and Department Affirmative Market Program (AMP) Coordinators are responsible for \\nmonitoring Contractor performance and other issues that arise during the life of the contract. In \\ndeveloping monitoring and evaluation procedures, the Commonwealth, through its Departments or PMTs, \\nshould strive for methods which rely on, among other things, national or industry standards and which are \\ncoordinated, cost efficient and appropriate to the level of risk to the Commonwealth in the purchase of the \\ncommodities or services. \\n \\nThe following are some tips that may provide assistance during contract monitoring: \\nContract compliance: \\n• \\nAssign a contract manager with the authority, resources, time, skill and adequate training to do the \\nmonitoring. \\n• \\nPeriodically review the language in the contract to verify the Contractor is complying with terms of the \\ncontract. \\n• \\nEnsure compliance with any state or federal laws or regulations which have been specified in the \\ncontract. The contract manager may ask for documentation from the Contractor at any time to verify \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 42 of 48 \\nthis compliance. Examples include tax compliance, current worker’s compensation contributions, \\ncurrent unemployment insurance documentation or compliance with the Affirmative Market Program \\nPlan. \\n• \\nIf the RFR required bidders to include resumes of key individuals they planned to use to fulfill the \\nrequirements of the contract, Departments should periodically check to be sure these same key \\nindividuals are, in fact, performing those contract requirements. \\n• \\nManage Affirmative Market Program (AMP) Plans by ensuring compliance of M/WBE commitments; \\nreview reports regarding usage of subcontractors M/WBEs for the purposes of Departmental credit \\ntoward fiscal year benchmarks. \\n \\nContract performance: \\n \\n• \\nDocument the date, time and name of the Contractor representative who has contacted the \\nDepartment regarding contract performance, questions, etc. Document any responses given. \\n• \\nReview and require progress reports to verify if the Contractor is meeting targeted performance \\ndeadlines or ask for documentation to support that performance is on schedule. \\n• \\nConduct announced or unannounced site visits and record reviews. \\n• \\nSolicit customer feedback on Contractor performance, outcomes and value. \\n• \\nDocument the date, time and name of the Contractor representative who has contacted the \\nDepartment regarding contract disputes. Document how the dispute was resolved. If the dispute is not \\nimmediately resolved, or may involve contract interpretation, immediately contact the Department \\nlegal staff for guidance (if the Department has no legal staff, then contact the secretariat). If the \\ndispute involves the potential for or a threat of litigation, the Department legal staff should \\nimmediately consult with the Attorney General’s Office Trial Division for guidance. \\n \\nContract deliverables and payment: \\n \\n• \\nReview all deliverables submitted or shipped to the Department to ensure they are in compliance with \\nthe contract specifications. Departments should be careful to instruct individuals signing for packages \\nthat it is necessary to, at a minimum, verify the type and number of items or packages received prior \\nto signing for any shipping order. Some contractors use shipping companies rather than delivering \\npackages themselves. It is important to verify at least the number of packages received. Final review \\nand acceptance or rejection of the items delivered may be made later. \\n• \\nCompare invoices and charges to contract terms and conditions. \\n• \\nPromptly review invoices upon receipt and return any rejected invoice with an explanation for its \\nrejection. Depending upon Department established internal control procedures, the contract manager \\nor the responsible accounts payable person generally does this review. A Department may hold or \\nreject an invoice, upon notice to a Contractor, until a Contractor has completed required performance \\nor corrected poor performance. It may also hold or reject an invoice in the event of a breach of \\ncontract or default. \\n• \\nWithhold final payment or invoice until final performance is completed. \\n• \\nRetain documentation supporting delivery and/or payment issues with the Contractor. \\n \\nContract termination or renewals: \\n \\n• \\nAt least six months prior to the termination date of the contract (longer for complex procurements), \\ndetermine any remaining available options to renew or begin a new competitive procurement process. \\n• \\nIf exercising an option to renew, forward the amendment documentation for completion and execution \\nat least 30 days prior to termination date of contract. \\n• \\nIf the contract is being terminated, notify the Contractor of the termination date. Include any \\nperformance which has not been completed and a list of Department data, personal data, files, \\nequipment or other Department property which must be returned to the Department at the \\ntermination of the contract. \\n \\nGeneral: \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 43 of 48 \\n• \\nReview the procurement file to verify that all documentation is available and that its location, if \\nelectronic or in another file, is identified. \\n• \\nRequire formal or informal audits of a Contractor’s records as specified in the Request for Response. \\n \\nThe contract manager may want to develop a checklist that can be attached to the procurement file, or an \\nelectronic file with an automatic date flag to remind the contract manager of deadlines and other \\nreminders during the contract period. Contract managers should regularly evaluate the quality and overall \\nsuccess of the Contractor in meeting the requirements of the contract by asking: \\n \\n• \\nConsidering all factors, did the procurement generate the best value for the customer? \\n• \\nWere customers or recipients of the service satisfied with the performance of the Contractor? \\n• \\nWhat are suggestions for improving service delivery and how can they be incorporated into the \\nexisting contract or future procurements? \\n \\nIf a Contractor’s poor performance is serious enough to suggest contract termination, debarment or \\ndisqualification actions, documentation regarding customer satisfaction should be used to support the \\ncontract manager’s decision. \\n \\nGuidelines for Monitoring and Enforcing Compliance of the Affirmative Market Program (AMP) \\nPlan for Large Procurements \\n \\nThe Executive Office for Administration and Finance (ANF) and the Operational Services Division (OSD) \\njointly issue the Affirmative Market Program (AMP) portion of the RFR for use by agencies. It is the \\nexpectation that all parties act in good faith in the execution of this AMP policy. The prime Contractor \\nshould immediately communicate any difficulties relative to compliance with AMP requirements to the \\ncontract manager, PMT or AMP Coordinator. Once the contract manager, PMT or AMP Coordinator has had \\nan opportunity to make an assessment of the circumstances and issues involved, appropriate measures \\nwill be taken to address any concerns or issues of non-compliance for all parties involved. A Contractor \\nmay be considered out of compliance with the AMP Plan under certain conditions, including, but not limited \\nto, the following: \\n \\n• \\nThe timeline of the benchmark has not been met. \\n• \\nThe AMP form(s), verification(s) of certification or verification of expenditures with M/WBEs are \\nmaterially incomplete by the due date or have not been submitted in accordance with the contract \\nrequirements. \\n• \\nThere has been a change in or substitution to identified M/WBEs without prior notification to and \\napproval by the contract manager or AMP Coordinator. \\n \\nIf the Contractor or subcontractor is not in compliance with the terms agreed to in the AMP Plan, the \\ncontract manager or AMP Coordinator should work closely with the Contractor to resolve any outstanding \\nissues. This may involve informal discussions with the Contractor about the specific AMP related problem \\nand include a meeting with the Contractor to discuss the issue. The Contractor shall provide information \\nas is necessary in the judgment of the contract manager, PMT or AMP Coordinator to ascertain its \\ncompliance with the terms agreed to in the AMP Plan. \\n \\nIf no resolution occurs and the problem continues, more formal steps should be taken, including the \\nfollowing: \\n \\n• \\nSend written notice to the Contractor from the contract manager, PMT or AMP Coordinator describing \\nthe problem, proposed solution and response time required. Send a copy of the notice to the PTL and \\nOSD, if applicable. \\n• \\nConduct follow-up meetings with the Contractor.  \\n• \\nInitiate formal corrective action plans with written notice from the procuring agency or OSD, as \\nappropriate, if no resolution has occurred at this point. \\n• \\nReview invoices upon receipt for the purpose of determining whether to reject said invoices. Any \\nrejected invoices will be returned with a written explanation for its rejection. This may occur at any \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 44 of 48 \\ntime during the period of non-compliance with the AMP Plan (depending upon agency-established \\ninternal control procedures, the contract manager, PMT or AMP Coordinator and in conjunction with the \\nresponsible accounts payable person). Upon notice to the Contractor, an agency may suspend a \\ncontract until a Contractor has resolved the AMP non-compliance. An agency may also impose a \\npenalty fee, upon notice, if it has statutory authority and has specified the potential for a penalty in \\nthe RFR. \\n• \\nRefer the matter to the agency’s legal counsel if a Contractor’s poor performance in meeting their AMP \\nPlan benchmarks is serious enough to suggest contract termination, debarment or disqualification \\nactions. \\n \\nThe contract manager, PMT or AMP Coordinator should maintain sufficient documentation of all written or \\nverbal communication to support the actions taken to resolve any non-compliance issues with the AMP \\nPlan. Please see the associated guidance entitled Affirmative Market Program, available via a link at the \\nend of this document for more information. \\n \\nResolution of Customer Complaints \\n \\nA key part of customer satisfaction is the resolution of customer complaints. Once received, the \\ncomplaints should be responded to promptly and a resolution process begun. One suggested approach for \\nresolving complaints might include the following: \\n \\n• \\nAcknowledge the complaint and get details from the end-user/complainant. \\n• \\nCritically review the Request for Response/contract for adequacy, specificity and clarity. \\n• \\nInformally contact the Contractor about the specific complaint, RFR or contract language, and propose \\nor invite a solution, such as: \\n \\n1. Ad hoc fix. \\n2. Contract change, if needed. \\n3. Need for additional complaint details. \\n4. Joint meeting with Contractor and customer, if desired. \\n \\nPlace all documentation related to the resolution in the procurement file. \\n \\nUsually, this informal process will resolve most complaints. However, the contract manager may wish to \\nfollow-up with the customer in question, as well as other customers who have not complained, to ensure \\nthe problem is successfully resolved and is not indicative of a pattern of poor performance. If no resolution \\noccurs and the problem continues, more formal steps should begin as follows: \\n \\n• \\nProvide written notice from the Department to the Contractor, indicating the problem, the solution and \\nthe response time required; send a copy to the PTL and OSD, if applicable. \\n• \\nConduct a follow-up meeting with Contractor. \\n• \\nInitiate formal corrective action plans (with written notice from the procuring Department or OSD, as \\nappropriate) if there is no resolution. \\n \\n \\nAmendments \\n \\nEffective contract management requires a Department to monitor Contractor performance and \\ncompliance.  Although day to day contract correspondence and communications may be made \\nelectronically (email or fax)  any changes in performance, funding, obligations, or changes in the terms of \\na contract (including grants, subsidies, ISAs, etc.) must be memorialized contemporaneously with the \\nneed for the change in a formal contract amendment.  Electronic signatures or contracts are not yet \\nauthorized for contracts or amendments.  Therefore, Departments may negotiate an amendment \\nelectronically, but must finalize the amendment in the same manner as the contract with written (wet) \\nsignatures by authorized signatories of the Department and Contractor.  \\n \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 45 of 48 \\nPlease see “Amendments, Suspensions and Termination Policy” for additional detailed information \\nregarding amendments, changes in performance, changes in dates of service, time extensions, exercising \\noptions to renew, material changes in Contractor identity, changes in Contractor Tax Identification \\nNumber (TIN), Contractor legal name or address changes, contract suspensions and terminations.  \\n \\nNote: Regardless of Comm-PASS Subscriber status, every active vendor listed on a Contract in Comm-\\nPASS receives email notifications when a Contract is amended. An amendment on Comm-PASS does not \\nconstitute a legal change, but is merely a change to the record by the Contract manager. This means that \\nDepartment contract managers can use the Comm-PASS amend capabilities to communicate with all \\nvendors. For example, an amendment \"reason\" might read, “Fill out and return Affirmative Market \\nProgram (AMP) Plan, if applicable.” The form can be attached to the Forms and Terms page for easy \\naccess. \\n \\nContract Disputes, Litigation or Mediation \\n \\nIn most cases, contract disputes or conflicts arise due to miscommunication, misunderstandings, or lack of \\naccurate or timely information.  Enhanced communication and careful monitoring of contract performance \\ncan usually resolve most disputes.  Departments are encouraged to develop internal methods for resolving \\ndisputes.  If a Department is unsuccessful at resolving a dispute the Department may consider other \\nmethods such as litigation or mediation.   \\n \\nFiscal Staff should be instructed that they have an obligation to notify their General Counsel \\nimmediately whenever a potential contract dispute arises that may trigger the need for \\nintervention, alternative dispute resolution, or that may potentially result in litigation.   The \\nDepartment General Counsel is the key contact with the AGO and should contact the Attorney \\nGeneral’s Trial Division (617) 727-2200; for further assistance with approvals for mediation \\nor to refer potential contract dispute litigation. \\n \\nPlease see Policy “Amendments, Suspensions and Termination Policy” for additional information and \\nrecommendations related to amendments, suspensions and terminations.  \\n \\nViolation of State Finance Law \\n \\nAny Department Head or designee who knowingly violates state finance, or authorizes or directs \\nanother officer or employee to violate any provision of G.L. c. 29, or any rule or regulation \\npromulgated there under, or any other provision of law relating to the incurring of liability or expenditure \\nof public funds law shall be punished by fine of $1,000 or imprisonment for one year, or both.  See G.L. c. \\n29, § 66. \\n \\nConflict of Interest \\n \\nThe Conflict of Interest Law, G.L. c. 268A, is one of several laws that govern dealings with public officials \\nand employees. Contractors certify compliance with G.L. c. 268A each time they execute a Commonwealth \\nStandard Contract Form. In order to ensure the integrity that is critical to the public procurement process, \\nall Departments must make certain that employees and participants involved in the procurement process \\nare free from all conflicts of interest. A summary of the requirements is included below. Additional \\ninformation can be obtained from Departmental legal counsel or the State Ethics Commission guidelines \\nand Disclosures.  \\n \\n• Bribery - A Contractor may not offer or give anything to a public official in exchange for that \\nofficial agreeing to perform or not perform an official act. \\n \\n• Registered Executive and Legislative Agents - If a Contractor’s responsibilities involve \\ninteraction with the state legislature, the Executive branch, or independent authorities, the \\nContractor should contact the Secretary of the Commonwealth’s office regarding the requirement \\nto register as an executive or legislative agent. Registered agents may not give anything to a \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 46 of 48 \\npublic official or policy-making public employee, or to an immediate family member of a public \\nofficial or policy-making public employee. \\n \\n• Gifts and Gratuities - Even if a Contractor is not a registered agent, the Contractor may not give \\na public official or any public employee anything “of substantial value” for or because of the \\nofficial’s duties. State employees may, under appropriate circumstances, attend Contractor \\nsponsored seminars or trade shows where the state will benefit by receiving information about \\nproducts, new techniques, business trends, and other matters of concern to state purchasing. \\n \\n• Hiring Public Employees - Except in rare instances, a Contractor may not pay or otherwise \\ncompensate a public employee in connection with any matter that is “of direct and substantial \\ninterest” to their public employer. \\n \\n• Hiring Former Public Employees - Former public employees and their business partners may \\nnever accept pay or other forms of compensation in connection with matters in which they \\nparticipated as public employees. Also, even if they did not personally participate in the matters, \\nthere is a one year period before former public officials may personally appear before government \\nDepartments in connection with matters that had been under their official responsibility. \\n \\nContractor Code of Conduct and Business Ethics. In the Standard Contract Form a Contractor \\ncertifies that performance under a Contract, in addition to meeting the terms of the Contract, will be made \\nusing ethical business standards and good stewardship of taxpayer and other public funding and resources \\nto prevent fraud, waste and abuse.  The Contractor certifies that a Code of Conduct and Business Ethics \\nwill be available for review upon request within 60 days of the Effective Date of this Contract which will be \\nprovided to all employees and subcontractors involved in contract performance.   \\n \\nRecords Management – Procurement and Contract Files   \\n \\nIn accordance with 815 CMR 10.00, the Department is the keeper of the official record copy of contracts \\nand invoices and all back up supporting documentation.  MMARS is the official record of the encumbrance \\nand payment documents entered into the system and will supersede any paper copies of the same \\ninformation.  The contract/procurement/payment file must contain or refer to the location of all \\ndocumentation related to the particular contract and payments.  A Department is responsible for retaining \\nand archiving contract records, (including invoices, back up supporting documentation and invoice \\nverification) in accordance with the Statewide Disposal Schedules issued by the Secretary of State Records \\nConservation Board.  Please see Policy “Records Management”. \\n \\nPublic Records and Access.  In the Standard Contract Form a Contractor shall provide full access to \\nrecords related to performance and compliance to the Department and officials listed under Executive \\nOrder 195 and G.L. c. 11, s.12 seven (7) years beginning on the first day after the final payment under \\nthis Contract or such longer period necessary for the resolution of any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit \\nor other inquiry involving this Contract. Access to view Contractor records related to any breach or \\nallegation of fraud, waste and/or abuse may not be denied and Contractor can not claim confidentiality or \\ntrade secret protections solely for viewing but not retaining documents. Routine Contract performance \\ncompliance reports or documents related to any alleged breach or allegation of non-compliance, fraud, \\nwaste, abuse or collusion may be provided electronically and shall be provided at Contractor’s own \\nexpense. Reasonable costs for copies of non-routine Contract related records shall not exceed the rates for \\npublic records under 950 C.M.R. 32.00.   \\n \\nProcurement/Contract File Contents \\n \\nDuring the life of the contract, additional information, which may be maintained electronically unless the \\noriginal or a written signature is required, will be added to the procurement file. This is in addition to \\ndocuments regarding the procurement process and contract execution. The file should be an accurate \\nrepresentation of all the facts, circumstances and details of both the procurement and ongoing contract \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 47 of 48 \\nperformance/management. Please see the policy document entitled How to Conduct a Procurement for \\ninformation about creating a procurement file. \\n \\nNote: Comm-PASS supports file versioning and file segregation, which can reduce the amount of paper \\nfiles. As long as an electronic version exists and does not contain information which is exempt from public \\nrecord law, e.g., bank routing codes, Department users can upload files to either the contract’s Forms and \\nTerms page or the Vendor(s) detail page. If a file must be replaced or updated, the previous versions will \\nbe retained within the record’s Amendment History located on the Other Information page. \\n \\nContract management related documents may include: \\n• \\nCopies of all invoices or where located (electronic or manual as required internally), including rejected \\ninvoices and notices to Contractor with reasons for rejection. \\n• \\nAn accounting of all payments made or where located (electronic or manual). \\n• \\nCopies of any written notices or other faxes, memoranda or correspondence with the Contractor. \\n• \\nDocumentation related to Contractor legal name change or material change in identity, including the \\nChange in Contractor Identity Form, if applicable. \\n• \\nContract amendments and related transactions, if applicable. \\n• \\nPurchase Order for Commodities and/or Services, if applicable. \\n• \\nDocumentation of contract monitoring and evaluation activities, such as performance reports, \\nsatisfaction surveys, site visit or audit documents, etc.  \\n• \\nAffirmative Market Program (AMP) Plans and vendor SOMWBA certification letters, if applicable. \\n• \\nInformation related to any contract disputes, including resolution. \\n• \\nDocumentation identifying any default, breach or unsatisfactory performance (notice should identify \\nlanguage in the contract detailing performance requirements and how the Contractor is failing to \\ncomply). \\n• \\nAny other information or documentation about the Contractor and contract performance that the \\ncontract manager deems relevant. \\n• \\nDocumentation related to negotiations pertaining to options to renew. \\n \\nPayroll Documentation \\nThe following list includes some examples of the types of documentation to be retained for payroll  and \\nhuman resource (HR) purposes.  Departments are required to keep all human resource (HR) and payroll \\nrelated documentation confidential and in a secured location accessible only to personnel required to enter \\nHR or payroll related transactions and adjustments. \\n\\uf0a7 \\nTime and attendance records signed by employee and supervisor, including hours worked and \\nleave taken; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nPosting to cumulative records; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nSigned contracts describing scope of services and rate to be paid to contract employees; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nProper allocation or distribution of employees’ time and cost to applicable Department; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nHiring letters or appointment documentation; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nPayroll certifications; and approvals where necessary; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nW-4 Forms and other documentation related to tax deductions; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nVoluntary and Involuntary payroll deduction or garnishment forms, including direct deposit, \\ndeferred compensation programs, Dependent Care Assistance forms, Insurance forms and \\nchanges, reimbursement requests; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nback up documentation related to payroll activities, changes or adjustments; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nEmployment claims, grievances, law suites and resolution documentation; \\n\\uf0a7 \\nPerformance reviews; and \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAny other documentation related to employment. \\nInternal Controls \\nThe Comptroller publishes Internal Control guidelines in consultation with the State Auditor’s Office.  All \\nDepartments are required to file an Internal Control Plan and review and update this plan to ensure fiscal \\nresponsibility and accountability. See G.L. c. 7A, § 9A.  Departments should be evaluating the risks related \\nto contracts and payments based upon the specific types of contracts and payments made and developing \\n \\nState Finance Law and General Requirements \\nPage 48 of 48 \\ninternal controls to mitigate these risks.
